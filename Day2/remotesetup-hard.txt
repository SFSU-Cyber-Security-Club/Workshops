Setting up a remote session
-all the tough works been setup already in container
-however, if you would like to recreate the steps i've taken, 
-go to the bottom of the page


-------------------
- cd container
- docker build -t bufferme .
- docker run -p 1337:1337 bufferme:latest
- give it a few minutes before attempting to connect..

(if you're on your machine, go to a separate terminal and do..)
- ncat localhost 1337

(if you're on a separate machine, trying to connect to the host to play..)
- ip addr  <-- grab the ip
- ncat <ip here> 1337



Method for building the docker ( for future reference )
This method requires improvement ( implement chroot jail for sh sessions )
--------------------

- mkdir app
- cd app
# compile the source code as you would originally do (see localsetup file)
# move the compiled code to app
- ldd <compiled code>
# bottom two are the linked libraries that are used to run the program
# its usually glibc and ld-linker
# im going to assume your libc is located /usr/lib
- cp /usr/lib/libc.so.6 .
- cp /usr/lib/ld-linux-x86_64.so.2 .

# ldd shows that the compiled code still links to glibc from root filesystem
# no good
# link it to the local

- patchelf --set-interpreter ./ld-linux-x86_64.so.2
- patchelf --replace-needed libc.so.6 ./libc.so.6 <compiled code>

# now you're done with that
# create a flag.txt, the compiled code will somehow interact with that right?

- mv /path/to/flag.txt .

# create a xinetd and run.sh file
# simply copy the template provided from here
# change run.sh so that it runs your executable instead

# from..
```
     cd /home/user && ./bufferme

```
# to ...
```
    cd /home/user && ./<compiled code>
```


- cd ..

- vim Dockerfile
# Just copy the template provided, change it up 
# Specifically this part

```
RUN chown -R root:root . && \
    chmod 444 flag.txt ASCIART.txt && \
    chmod a+x bufferme ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 libc.so.6 && \
    chmod +x /run.sh

```

# This sets the permissions for each file that was in the app directory
# replace buffer ld.... with your libraries and executables
# so it should look like

```
RUN chown -R root:root . && \     
    chmod 444 flag.txt && \    
    chmod a+x <compiled code> <library1> <library2>... && \ 
    chmod +x /run.sh 
```

you're pretty much done..
run the setup mentionned above to build and run the docker
everything should work!



(P.S: in your C code, make sure to setbuf stdin,stderr, and stdout to 0!)
