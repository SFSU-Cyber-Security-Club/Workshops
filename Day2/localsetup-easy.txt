To setup a local session, simply compile
the source code with the following flags (disables mitigations)

gcc overflowMe.c -o bufferme -fno-stack-protector -no-pie  -z relro
    -----------     -------                 |       |         | disables randomized offsets to addresses
       source       execs name              |     makes addresses static
                                        disables buffer overflow protector lol

you should be able to start right away by executing
./bufferme
