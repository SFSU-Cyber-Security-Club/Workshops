                   MULTILITERAL SUBSTITUTION



SUMMARY

Welcome back from the Thanksgiving holiday break.   The good
news is that this lecture will come to you about Christmas,
therefore, no homework.  The not so good news is that this
concluding Lecture 4 on Substitution with Variants covers some
difficult material of wide practically in the field.

In Lecture 4, we complete our look into English monoalphabetic
substitution ciphers, by describing multiliteral substitution
with difficult variants.  The Homophonic and GrandPre Ciphers
will be covered.  The use of isologs is demonstrated.  A
synoptic diagram of the substitution ciphers described in
Lectures 1-4 will be presented.


MULTILITERAL SUBSTITUTION WITH MULTIPLE-EQUIVALENT CIPHER
ALPHABETS  - aka "MONOALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION WITH VARIANTS"

Each English letter in plain text has a characteristic
frequency which affords definite clues in the solution of
simple monoalphabetic ciphers.  Associations which individual
letters form in combining to make up words, and the
peculiarities which certain of them manifest in plain text,
afford further direct clues by means of which ordinary
monoalphabetic substitution encipherments of such plain text
may be readily solved.                  [FR1]

Cryptographers have devised methods for disguising,
suppressing, or eliminating the foregoing characteristics in
the cryptograms produced by methods described in Lectures 1-3.
One category of methods call "variants or variant values" is
that in which the letters of the plain component of a cipher
alphabet are assigned two or more cipher equivalents.

Systems involving variants are generally multiliteral.  In such
systems, there are a large number of equivalents made available
by combinations and permutations of a limited number of
elements, each letter of the plain text may be represented by
several multiliteral cipher equivalents which may be selected
at random.  For example, if 3-letter combinations are employed
as multiliteral equivalents, there are 26**3 or 17,576
available equivalents for the 26 letters of the plain text.



They may be assigned in equal numbers of different equivalents
for the 26 letters, in which case each letter would be
representable by 676 different 3 letter equivalents or they
be assigned on some other basis, for example proportionately to
the relative frequencies of the plain text letters.  [FR1]

The primary object of substitution with variants is again to
provide several values which may be employed at random in a
simple substitution of cipher equivalents for the plain text
letters.

As a slight diversion, the reader may ask about uniliteral
substitution with variants.  It is but not very practical.
Note the following cipher alphabet constructed in French by
Captain Roger Baudouin in reference [BAUD]:


Plain:   A B C D E F G H I L M N O P Q R S T U V X Z
Cipher:  L G O R F Q A H C M B T I D N P U S Y E W J
                 K             X         Z
                 V


(Note that the Captain was not an ACA member.  The H=H
combination is not allowed.)

Baudouin proposed that the J and Y plain be replaced by I plain
and K plain by C plain or Q plain and W plain by VV plain. Four
cipher letters would be available as variants for the high-
frequency plain text letters in French.

Mixed alphabets formed by including all repeated letters of the
key word or key phrase in the cipher component were common in
Edgar Allen Poe's day but are impractical because they are
ambiguous, making decipherment difficult; for example:


Enciphering Alphabet:

Plain : a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
Cipher: N O W I S T H E T I M E F O R A L L G O O D M E N T


Inverse form for deciphering

Cipher: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Plain : p     v h m s g d     q k a b     o e f     c
                l       j     r w y n         i
                x                   t         z
                                    u


The average cipher clerk would have difficulty in decrypting a
cipher group such as TOOET, each letter having 3 or more
equivalents, from which plain text fragments (n)inth, ft
thi(s),  it thi, etc. can be formed on decipherment.  [FR1]


THEORETICAL DISTINCTIONS

In simple or single-equivalent monoalphabetic substitution with
variants, two points are evident:

1) the same letter of the plain text is invariable represented
   by but one and always the same character or cipher unit of
   the cryptogram.

2) The same character or cipher unit of the cryptogram
   invariably represents one and always the same letter of the
   plain text.

In multiliteral - equivalent monoalphabetic substitution with
variants, two points are also evident:

1) the same letter of the plain text may be represented by one
   or more different characters or cipher units of the
   cryptogram.  But,

2) The same character or cipher unit of the cryptogram
   nevertheless invariably represents one and always the same
   letter of the plain text.

The matrices in Figures 4 -1 to 4-10 represent some of the
simpler means for accomplishing monoalphabetic substitution
with variants.  The matrices are extensions of the basic ideas
of multiliteral substitution presented in Lecture 3.

The variant equivalents for any plain text letter may be chosen
at will; thus, in Figure 4-1, e= 10, 15, 60, or 65; in Figure
4-2, e= AU, AZ, FU, FZ, LU or LZ.

Encipherment by means of matrices shown in Figures 4-2, 4-3,
4-6 is commutative. The coordinates may be read row by column
or visa versa.  There is no cryptographic ambiguity.  The
remaining matrices are noncommutative.  The general convention
is to read row by column.

In Figures 4-5 and 4-6, the letters in the square have been
inscribed in such a manner that, coupled with the particular
arrangement of the row and column coordinates, the number of
variants available for each plain text letter is roughly
proportional to the frequencies of the letters in the
plain text.  Figure 35 incorporates a keyword on top of this
idea.  [FR1]
HOMOPHONIC

The Homophonic Cipher is a simple variant system. It is a
4-level (alphabets) dinome cipher.   Consider Figure 4-11.

The keyword TRIP is found by inspecting dinomes 01, 26, 51, and
76.  (The lowest number in each of the four sequences.)
[FR1] [FR5]

The Russians added an interesting gimmick called the Disruption
Area.  Consider Figure 4-12 and note the slashes under  U - X
for the fourth level of dinomes.   The famous VIC cipher used
this feature very effectively.   [NIC4]

The keyword NAVY is represented by dinomes 01, 27, 53, and 79.

Security for Homophonic systems is greatly improved if the
dinomes and the four sequences are assigned randomly.  However,
the easy mnemonic feature of the keyworded four sequences is
lost.

The Mexican Cipher device is a Homophonic consisting of five
concentric disks, the outer disk bearing 26 letters and the
other four bearing sequences 01-26, 27-52, 53-78, 79-00.
The cipher disk enhances frequent key changes.  Figure  4-12
shows the matrix without the disruption area.  [FR5] [NIC4]

Assuming we did not know that the above cryptogram was a
HOMOPHONIC, we might may a preliminary analysis to see if we
are dealing with a cipher or a code.  We will cover code
systems later in the course, but a few introductory remarks
might be in order.  The five letter groups could indicate
either a cipher or a code.

If the cryptogram contains an even number of digits, as for
example 494 in the previous message, this leaves open the
possibility that the message is a cipher containing 247 pairs
of digits; were the number of digits an exact odd multiple of
five, such as 125, 135, etc., the possibility that the
cryptogram is in code of the 5-figure group type must be
considered.

We next study the message repetitions and what their
characteristics are.  If the cipher text is of 5-figure code
type, then such repetitions as appear should generally be in
whole groups of five digits, and they should be visible in the
text just as the message stands, unless the code message has
been superenciphered.  If the cryptogram is a cipher, then
repetitions should extend beyond the 5-digit groupings; if they
conform to any definite at all they should for the most part
contain even numbers of digits since each letter is probably
represented by a pair (dinome) of digits.

We start with 4-part frequency distribution.  We next assume
a 25 character alphabet from 01-00.  This is the common scheme
of drawing up the alphabets.  Breaking the text into dinomes
(2-digit) pairs yields:

01 ///           26 ///            51 /////         76 //////
02               27                52 /////         77 /

What we have before us are four simple, monoalphabetic
frequency distributions similar to those involved in a
monoalphabetic substitution cipher using standard cipher
alphabets.  The next step is to fit the distribution to the
normal.   Since I=J for the 25 letter alphabet, we find that
the Keyword is JUNE and the following alphabets result:

01  I-J    26  U     51  N      76  E
02  K      27  V     52  O      77  F
03  L      28  W     53  P      78  G
04  M      29  X     54  Q      79  H
05  N      30  Y     55  R      80  IJ
06  O      31  Z     56  S      81  K
07  P      32  A     57  T      82  L
08  Q      33  B     58  U      83  M
09  R      34  C     59  V      84  N
10  S      35  D     60  W      85  O
11  T      36  E     61  X      86  P
12  U      37  F     62  Y      87  Q
13  V      38  G     63  Z      88  R
14  W      39  H     64  A      89  S
15  X      40  IJ    65  B      90  T
16  Y      41  K     66  C      91  U
17  Z      42  L     67  D      92  V
18  A      43  M     68  E      93  W
19  B      44  N     69  F      94  X
20  C      45  O     70  G      95  Y
21  D      46  P     71  H      96  Z
22  E      47  Q     72  IJ     97  A
23  F      48  R     73  K      98  B
24  G      49  S     74  L      99  C
25  H      50  T     75  M      00  D


The first groups of the cryptogram decipher as follows:

68 32 10 90 22 48 05 76 51 11 88 64 84 20 36 45 23
e  a  s  t  e  r  n  e  n  t  r  a  n  c  e  o  f


If a 26-element alphabet were used only the distribution
analysis would have been changed to be on a basis of 26, the
process of fitting the distribution to the normal would be the
same.

PLAIN COMPONENT COMPLETION METHOD

Suppose we know that two correspondents have been using the
same variant system as in the previous Homophonic.
The message intercepted is:


48226   88423   52099   93604   76059   05651   36683   52267
97114   54466   76

A variation of the plain-component completion method can be
used to crack the new message.  We copy the message into
dinomes and separate by levels.

48 22 68 84 23 52 09 99 36 04 76 05 90 56 51 36 68 35 22 67 97
--------------------------------------------------------------
2   1  3  4  1  3  1  4  2  1  4  1  4  3  3  2  3  2  1  3  4

11 45 44 66 76
--------------
 1  2  2  3  4

Levels

(1)  22 23 09 04 05 22 11
(2)  48 36 36 35 45 44
(3)  68 52 56 51 68 67 66
(4)  84 99 76 90 97 76

These dinomes are converted into terms of plain component by
setting each of the cipher sequences against the plain
component at an arbitrary point of coincidence, such as the
following:


A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   IJ  K   L   M   N
01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13
26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38
51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63
76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88

O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z
14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25
39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50
64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75
89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  00






So:

Levels

(1)  22=W; 23=X; 09=I; 04=D; 05=E; 22=W; 11=L
(2)  48=X; 36=L; 36=L; 35=K; 45=U; 44=T
(3)  68=S; 52=B; 56=F; 51=A; 68=S; 67=R; 66=Q
(4)  84=I; 99=Y; 76=A; 90=P; 97=W; 76=A

This method works because both the plain component (A,B..) and
the cipher component (01, 02..) are known sequences.

The plain-component sequence is completed on the letters of the
four levels by Caesar Rundown, as follows:


Level 1           Level 2          Level 3          Level 4

The generatrices with the best assortment of high frequency
letters for the four levels are:

Level 1           Level 2          Level 3          Level 4

EFRMNET           REEDON           EOSNEDC          NCETAE







Arranging the letters of these generatrices in order of
appearance of their dinome equivalents, according to levels we
have:

48 22 68 84 23 52 09 99 36 04 76 05 90 56 51 36 68 35 22 67 97

         N            C        E     T                       A


The plain text reads "Reinforcements needed a[t once]".
Looking at the equivalents 01,26, 51, 76 we reveal the keyword
JUNE.

In evaluating generatrices, the sum of the arithmetic
frequencies of the letters in each row may be used as an
indication of the relative "goodness".  A statistically better
procedure uses the logarithm of the probabilities of the plain
text letters forming the generatrices.  See [FR2]

The Homophonic is a popular cipher and has been discussed in
several issues of The Cryptogram as well as LEDGES' NOVICE
NOTES.  See references [HOM1 -HOM6] and [LEDG].

For our computer bugs,  TATTERS Homophonic solver is very easy
to use and available on the Crypto Drop Box.

MORE COMPLICATED TYPES OF CIPHER ALPHABETS WITH VARIANTS

GRANDPRE

Consider the cipher matrices shown in figures 4-11 to 4-13.
These are called frequential matrices, since the number of
cipher values available for any given plain text letter closely
approximates its relative plain text frequency.

               ( 676 - cell matrix )

In figure 4-11, the number of occurrences of a particular
letter within the matrix is proportional to the frequency in
plain text; the letters are inscribe in random manner, in order
to enhance the security of the system.

In figure 4-12, the same idea as 4-11 is presented in reduced
form from 26 x 26 to 10 x 10.  The letters have been inscribed
by a simple diagonal route, from left to right, within the
square, and the coordinates scrambled by means of a key word
or key number.

Figure 4-13 illustrates the famous Grandpre Cipher; in this
square ten words are inscribed containing all the letters of
the alphabet and linked by a column keyword ("equivalent") as a
mnemonic for inscription of the row words.  ACA literature also
covers this cipher.  See references [LEDG] and [GRA1 - 3] for
solution hints for the Grandpre cipher.






SACCO

General Luigi Sacco proposed a frequential-type system that
uses both enciphering and deciphering matrices.  The inscribed
dinomes were completely disarranged by applying a double
transposition to suppress the relationships between letters.
References [SACC] and [FR1] both give a good description of the
process.   The number of variant values in this system are
reflective of the Italian language.

BACONIAN

The Baconian ciphers found in the Cryptogram are a variant
system.  The "a" elements may be represented by any one of 20
consonants as variants, while the "b" elements may be
represented by any one of 6 vowels; or the letters A-M may be
used to represent the "a" elements and the letters N-Z for the
"b" elements; digits may be used for either the "a" or "b"
elements, either on the basis of first five or last five
digits, or odd versus even digits, or the first 10 consonants
(B-M) and the last 10 consonants (N-Z)


SUMMING-TRINOME

Friedman describes a complex variant known as the summing-
trinome system.  Each plain text letter is assigned a value
from 1-26; this value is expressed as a trinome, the digits of
which sum to the designated value of the letter.  The letter
assigned the value of 4 may be represented by any of 15
permutations and combinations.  Friedman discusses further ways
of complication including disarrangement, addition of
punctuation and nulls.  See [FR1] pages 109-110.  Note the
inverted normal distribution representation of this cipher.


ANALYSIS OF A SIMPLE VARIANT EXAMPLE

X M D T S   M G F D R   D K L W J   F L P J M   S F Q W B
F N C B Z   D K V W G   Z S H B H   D H J C X




Note the total absence of A, E, I, O, U, and Y.  Remarkable
and definitely nonrandom event.  Since a uniliteral
substitution alphabet with 6 letters missing is highly
unlikely, the next guess is we are dealing with a multiliteral
substitution.   Closer inspection shows that ten consonants are
initials (B D G J L N Q S V X) and the remaining ten consonants
are used as terminals (C F H K M P R T W Z).  This implies both
bipartite and biliteral character.

We construct a digraphic distribution:

                  C  F  H  K  M  P  R  T  W  Z
                ...............................
              B . 3  1  1  1  1  2  2  1  2  1 .
              D . 4  1  3  3  1  1  1  3  4  2 .
              G . 2  2  2     3        1     1 .
              J . 1  1  1  1  1  1  2  1  1  1 .
              L . 1  4     4  3  4  5  3  3  4 .
              N . 4  1  4  3  1  1  1  2  3  3 .
              Q .    2     2  1  1  1     1    .
              S . 1  2  2     2  1           1 .
              V . 1  4  1  3  4  4  4  3  4  3 .
              X .    1     1  2  1  1     2    .
                ...............................

We assume the use of a small enciphering matrix with variants
for rows and columns.  We assume that the various possible
cipher variants are of approximately equal frequency; the
column indicators pair equally often with the row indicators
of the enciphering matrix.  We look for similar row profiles
and column profiles.  We match first the rows and then the
columns.

Row  L and V distributions have pronounced similarities.  They
are "heavy" in their frequency distributions in the same
places.  So are rows D and N.  They have homologous attributes
in appearance.


               C  F  H  K  M  P  R  T  W  Z

     L       . 1  4     4  3  4  5  3  3  4 .
     V       . 1  4  1  3  4  4  4  3  4  3 .

     D       . 4  1  3  3  1  1  1  3  4  2 .
     N       . 4  1  4  3  1  1  1  2  3  3 .

Finding the next rows are not obvious.  We use a "goodness of
match" procedure to equate interchangeable variants.  We
calculate the cross-product sums for each trial.  The next
heavy row is G.  We test G against the remaining rows.

     G       . 2  2  2     3        1     1 .
     B       . 3  1  1  1  1  2  2  1  2  1 .
     G*B +     6  2  2     3        1     1   = 15

We compare the balance of rows

     G*B +      6  2  2     3        1     1   = 15
     G*J +      2  2  2     3        1     1   = 11
     G*Q +         4        3                  =  7
     G*S +      2  4  4     6              1   = 17 !
     G*X +         2        6                  =  8

The results are most probably match G and S.

The next heaviest row is B.  Testing against the remaining
three rows we have:

     B*J +      3  1  1  1  1  2  4  1  2  1   = 17
     B*Q +         2     2  1  2  2     2  1   = 12
     B*X +         1     1  2  2  2     4      = 12

The correct pairings are B with J and Q with X.  Since we have
not found more than two rows for any one set of interchangeable
values the original matrix has only five rows.

                  C  F  H  K  M  P  R  T  W  Z
                ...............................
           B  J . 4  2  2  2  2  3  4  2  3  2 .
           D  N . 8  2  8  7  2  2  2  5  7  5 .
           G  S . 3  4  4     5  1     1     2 .
           L  V . 2  8  1  7  7  8  9  6  7  7 .
           Q  X .    3     3  3  2  2     3    .
                ................................

     Values represent the sums of the combined rows.
We apply the same process to matching columns.  C and H are
a matched pair.  F with M and P with R.  We use the cross
product sums for the balance of the columns.

           K*T+:  4  35  - 42  - =  81
           K*W+:  4  49  - 49  9 = 113
           K*Z+:  4  35  - 49  - =  88
           T*W+:  6  35  - 42  - =  83
           T*Z+:  4  25  2 42  - =  73
           W*Z+:  6  35  - 49  - =  90

                Combinations:

           KT, WZ:   81 +  90 = 171
           KW, TZ:   113 + 73 = 186
           KZ, TW:   88  + 83 = 171

We would expect that the proper pairings are K with W and T
with Z.

The converted cryptogram is solved via the principals in

forecast.  The original keying matrix is recovered with a
keyword of ATMOSPHERIC.

 The method of matching rows and columns applies equally well
for all the matrices shown previously.  It is key to start with
the best rows and columns from not only heaviness standpoint
but the distinctive crests and troughs.   A second key is the
low frequency letters.  No variant system can adequately
disguise low frequency letters and they will have the same
frequency in the cipher text.  Friedman describes a more
general solution to variant analysis. [FRE1, p119 ff]

Chapter 10 of reference [FRE1] covers the disruption process
associated with monome-dinome alphabets of Irregular-Length
cipher text units.  Figures 4-14 and Figure 4-15 show
enciphering matrices where the encipherment is disrupted and
commutative.  The normal row conventions are used to encipher
except when the row indicator was the same for the immediately
preceding letter.  In Figure 4-14, EIGHT could be encrypted
10 29 7 8 49 and then rearranged into standard groups of 5
letters (numbers).  In Figure 4-15, E = 24 or 42, T = 621 or
162.  Figure 4-16 is an example of the Russian disruption
process added for security.





ISOLOGS

Cryptograms produced using identical plain text but subjected
to different cryptographic treatment, and yielding different
cipher texts are called isologs.  (isos = equal and logos =
word in Greek).  Isologs are usually equal or nearly equal in
length.  Isologs, no matter how the cryptographic treatment
varies, are among the most powerful tools available to the
cryptanalyst to solve difficult cryptosystems.

Take two messages A and B suspected of being isologs and write
them out under each other.  We then examine the similarities
and differences.   Assume the messages both start Reference
your message...   I will arrange the messages in a special
table to facilitate the study.

      Message A                       Message B


Both distributions are too flat - no crests or troughs.
We assume a variant system of a monoalphabetic cryptosystem.
[FRE3] shows us how to use a Poisson exponential distribution
to evaluate random text.  The gist of the statistics is that
the expected number of blanks is too low. The chi test
indicates extreme non randomness for both messages. The chi
test applied to both distributions implies that they both have
been enciphered by the same cryptosystem because there exists a
close correlation between the patterns of the two
distributions.  [FR1, p123} discusses the potentialities of the
cryptomathematics as a supporting science to cryptography.

There are several identical values between the messages.  This
implies that not only has the same cryptosystem been used but
also the same enciphering matrix.  The values 38 and 62 must
represent very low frequency letters because no variants are
even provided for this letter.

We now form isolog chains between the messages.

(06 14 15 26 28 31 35 73 74 81 89 98 99)
(02 07 20 22 43 44 63 90)
(12 37 48 51 69 70 83 94)
(03 30 41 54 65 82 97)
(05 10 24 32 49 87 93)
(16 18 36 76 78 79 86)
(27 45 53 64 80 92)
(11 39 75 88)
(21 58 77 84)
(46 59 68 72)
(00 52 67)
(04 55 61)
(08 29 56)
(19 71 96)
(01 25)
(13 85)          Single Dinomes:
(42 60)          (38)  (47)  (50)  (62)  (91)


These chains of cipher values represent identical plain text
pairs.  Beginning with the first value in the message 82 and 30
a partial chain of equivalent variants is formed; now locating
the other occurrences of either value we note the value that
coincides with it in the other message.  We therefore extend
the chain.

We now assign a different letter arbitrarily to each chain and
each single dinome value.  We convert the messages to
uniliteral terms and note the pattern of opening stereotype
"Reference your message" and then quickly recover text.
(This is how we attacked the German ciphers in WWII.) [NIC4]

The plain text values are arbitrarily fit into 10 x 10 square:


                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
                    ...................
                1 . D N H E E A - A C O
                2 . I T - O M E S E F T
                3 . E O - - E A N B D R
                4 . R Y T T S L V N O -
                5 . N U S R P F - I L X
                6 . P W T S R - U L N Y
                7 . C L E E D A I A A N
                8 . E R N I H A O D E S
                9 . G S O N - C R E E T
                0 . M T R P O E T F - U

Manipulating the rows and columns with a view to uncovering the
keys or symmetry, we find a latent diagonal pattern without
keyword.   We set up the following enciphering matrix:


                    6 8 9 1 5 4 3 7 2 0
                    ...................
                7 . A A A C D E E I L N
                1 . A A C D E E H K N O
                3 . A B D E E H J N O R
                8 . A D E E H I N O R S
                9 . C E E G I N O R S T
                2 . E E F I M O Q S T T
                0 . E F I M O P R T T U
                5 . F I L N P R S T U X
                6 . I L N P R S T U W Y
                4 . L N O R S T T V Y Z



I can not over emphasize the value of isologs. The value goes
far beyond simple variant systems. Isologs produced by two
different code books or two different enciphered code versions
of the same plain text; or two encryptions of identical plain
text at different settings of a cipher machine, may all prove
of inestimable value in the attack on a difficult system.

I presented Mv-1 in a strange format.  It fooled some but not
all.  The Key is 01=1=a, 02=2=b,...26=z.  the alphabet is
standard.  Message reads: " Here's a simple alphabetic code
that I've never seen before.  Maybe you can use it in you
column.  Martin Gardner, Hendersonville, North Carolina.


Solve and reconstruct the cryptographic systems used.

Divide the original cipher into pairs, noting that each pair
started with 0,1, or 2 and ended with 0 - 9.  Construct a
matrix similar to Figure 3-2. (3 x 10) Fill in the matrix with
A=01, ending with Z=26.  Used 00 =blank.  Reduce by converting
dinomes to letters.  Apply the Phi test and found mon-
alphabetic. Used frequency, VOC count, and consonant line to
identify B, H, E as vowels and N,D,X,C,I,Y,R,J, as possible
consonants.  Marking the message with these assumptions, found
last eight characters to be a pattern word in Cryptodict as
TOMORROW.   Working between cipher text and key alphabet
matrix, rest fell.

Message reads:Reconnoiter Auys Cayes Bay at daylight seventeen
April and then proceed through point George on course three
three zero speed twelve period report noon position tomorrow.

Noted all entries were numbered 1-5.  Assumed a 5 x 5 matrix
filled with a straight alphabet,  substituted letters for the
dinomes.  Used frequency count, contact count and phi test to
confirm mono-alphabeticity.  Identified 8 consonants and 2
vowels.  Made the E, T assumption based on frequency. First
word dropped as weather.  Rest of message fell apart with
addition of W, A, R to the matrix.

Message reads: Weather forecast Thursday partly cloudy ...
at present about one thousand feet.

Key = Beginning column 1 = MONDAY, in 5 x 5 matrix.

My last two problems were taken from reference [OP20] course.
