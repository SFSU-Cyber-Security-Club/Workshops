            ANNOTATED CRYPTOGRAPHIC RESOURCES
                      AND REFERENCES

                       -----------

Notes:

      o  Some cipher families are referenced as a group
         (ex.  [TRAN] for Transposition Ciphers:
         Columnar, Incomplete Columnar, Tramp, Skipping
         Tramp, etc.)

      o  The Cryptogram, is the bimonthly publication of
         the American Cryptogram Association.  These
         references are both scholarly and cipher
         specific. I have updated them through 1996.
         They are available through the ACA Treasurer at
         the address in the front of this book or Volume
         I of my course.

      o  Cryptographic resources presented explore all
         phases of involvement with cryptography:
         cryptanalysis, history, legal, social,
         classical, modern, NSA, mathematical
         techniques, recreational, intelligence,
         tactical, strategic, nuclear, National Defense,
         INFOSEC: Offensive and Defensive, Hardware, and
         Software.  Enjoy.

      o  Public - Key Cryptography references have
         additional annotations and may have some
         overlap with reference [NIST90], Lecture 19 on
         Law and Lectures 20 - 25 on modern issues
         surrounding cryptography.  These references
         represent state-of the-art 1990 -1993.

      o  About 100 web links to cryptographic sources
         have been added under the section Web Sources.
         A wealth of information on all levels is
         available.

      o  Pertinent cases involving cryptographic issues
         are cited by primary court.

      o  Senate and House bills are referenced by year
         and number, if appropriate.

       ISBN: 0-89412-263-0, Softbound, 8.38 x 10.75 in,
       xii + 301 pp.

       Mr. Nichols (aka LANAKI) is the outgoing
       President of the American Cryptogram Association
       (ACA).  In his truly great book, he covers the
       following:

       Volume I covers such diverse topics as
       Aristocrats (the king of puzzles found in the
       daily paper), Patristocrat (single language
       Aristocrats without word divisions), Xenocrypts
       (language ciphers other than English),
       Transposition ciphers, Military Ciphers,
       Cryptarithms, Polyalphabetics, Cipher Machines
       such as the ENIGMA (with simulation disk
       available) and special ciphers used in history,
       as well as their modern day equivalents.  Ciphers
       and cryptanalytic techniques for solution are
       presented.

[NIC~] Nichols, Randall K., " Classical Cryptography
       Course, Volume II," Aegean Park Press (C-76),
       ISBN: 0-89412-264-9, Softbound, 8.38 x 10.75 in,
       xii + 400 pp. 1996, $40.00.

       Volume II presents Lectures 11 - 20 (of a total
       of twenty five) from Mr. Nichols' extremely
       successful course in Classical Cryptography
       taught in 1995 and 1996 to 358 students via the
       Internet and regular mail.

       Volume II covers polyalphabetic substitutions
       ciphers in the Vigenere family (Viggy, Variant,
       Beaufort, Porta, Gronsfeld, Portax, Gromark),
       decimation, principles of symmetry, isologs and
       superimposition solution techniques.  Volume II
       describes the difficult aperiodic cipher systems
       (Interrupted key, Autoclave, Progressive, Running
       Key used in cipher machines) and their analysis
       by isomorphs, and repetitions. Cryptarithm
       solutions for extended bases are presented. The
       theory of coincidences and statistical attacks
       (kappa, chi, phi) that are derived from this
       important theory are detailed.

       Transposition theory and a variety of
       transposition ciphers are solved (Columnar,
       Amsco, Myszkowski, Cadenus, Grille, Swagman,
       Auto-Transposition).  Volume II has two chapters
       on the difficult cipher systems invented by the
       famous French cryptographer Delastelle:
       Foursquare, Bifid and Trifid.  Volume II ends
       with a chapter on passwords, law and data
       protection. Volume II is a potpourri of advanced
       topics in classical cryptography.

       Volume II includes over 1600 Cryptographic
       Resources and References covering all phases of
       cryptography: cryptanalysis, history, legal,
       social, classical, modern, NSA, mathematical
       techniques, recreational, intelligence, tactical,
       strategic, national defense, INFOSEC: offensive
       and defensive, hardware, software, standards,
       public key cryptography, web sources, and
       applicable Senate and House bills.  Readers are
       encouraged to expand their knowledge in the many
       directions possible to them through this section.

ON-LINE COURSES

The best course on the INTERNET by far is LANAKI's. It
is 25 Lectures long covering all phases of classical
cryptography.  The textbooks are [NICH] Nichols, Randall
K., " Classical Cryptography Course, Volume I," Aegean
Park Press (C-74), ISBN: 0-89412-263-0, Softbound, 8.38
x 10.75 in, xii + 301 pp. Professor Nichols (aka LANAKI)
is the retiring President of the American Cryptogram
Association (ACA) 1994-1996.  Classical Cryptography
Volume II was released in February, 1997. [NIC~]
Nichols, Randall K., " Classical Cryptography Course,
Volume II," Aegean Park Press (C-76), ISBN: 0-89412-264-
9, Softbound, 8.38 x 10.75 in, xii + 400 pp. 1996,
$40.00.

Volume I presents the first ten Lectures (of twenty
five) from Mr. Nichols' 1995 and 1996 on-going Classical
Cryptography Course taught to 461 students at all levels
of expertise.  Volume I covers such diverse topics as
Aristocrats (the king of cipher puzzles found in many
daily papers), Patristocrats (Aristocrats without word
divisions), Xenocrypts (language ciphers other than
English), Transpos-ition Ciphers, Military Ciphers,
Cryptarithms, the famous German ENIGMA Cipher Machine
(with simulation program disk available),
Polyalphabetics, and special historical ciphers.
Ciphers and their cryptanalytic techniques for solution
are presented.  Extensive foreign language data is
supplied.

Classical Cryptography Course Volume I represents the
best in intellectual stimulation - better than chess,
bridge, and couch potatohood combined.

                  -----------------

Volume II presents Lectures 11 - 20 (of a total of
twenty five) from Mr. Nichols' extremely successful
course in Classical Cryptography taught in 1995 and 1996
to 461 students via the Internet and regular mail.

Volume II covers polyalphabetic substitutions ciphers in
the Vigenere family (Viggy, Variant, Beaufort, Porta,
Gronsfeld, Portax, Gromark), decimation, principles of
symmetry, isologs and superimposition solution
techniques.  Volume II describes the difficult aperiodic
cipher systems (Interrupted key, Autoclave, Progressive,
Running Key used in cipher machines) and their analysis
by isomorphs, and repetitions.  Cryptarithm solutions
for extended bases are presented. The theory of
coincidences and statistical attacks (kappa, chi, phi)
that are derived from this important theory are
detailed.

Transposition theory and a variety of transposition
ciphers are solved (Columnar, Amsco, Myszkowski,
Cadenus, Grille, Swagman, Auto-Transposition).  Volume
II has two chapters on the difficult cipher systems
invented by the famous French cryptographer Delastelle:
Foursquare, Bifid and Trifid.  Volume II ends with a
chapter on passwords, law and data protection.  Volume
II is a potpourri of advanced topics in classical
cryptography.

Volume II includes over 1600 Cryptographic Resources and
References covering all phases of cryptography:
cryptanalysis, history, legal, social, classical,
modern, NSA, mathematical techniques, recreational,
intelligence, tactical, strategic, national defense,
INFOSEC: offensive and defensive, hardware, software,
standards, public key cryptography, web sources, and
applicable Senate and House bills.

The course is free to ACA members.  Two BBS, one
netserver, and the Crypto Drop Box are maintained with a
wealth of information, lectures and computer programs
for the serious student. Professor Nichols shares his 32
years of experience to about 358 students worldwide.
Nothing better on the net for the pricetag.  Be prepared
to work and enjoy yourself.

BOOK REVIEWS
 
REVIEW OF CLASSICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY COURSE, VOLUME I
By the honorable Louis Kruh, Editor/Founder CRYPTOLOGIA,
October 1996, Volume XX Number 4.

Nichols, president of the American Cryptogram
Association, 1994-1996, began a course in classical
cryptography in 1995 via the Internet and regular mail.
Presently, at its midpoint, the course is an over-
whelming success with more than 300 participants and
this volume, the first of two, consists of the first ten
lectures.  Nichols' goals are to teach the basic
cryptanalytic tools for solving different types of
ciphers while providing some understanding of the
historic context and importance of cipher systems to
communications.

Volume I covers simple substitution, substitution with
variants including complicated types of cipher
alphabets, multiliteral substitutions, Xenocrypts
(substitution ciphers in languages other than English)
cryptarithms, Hill's algebraic cipher, German Enigma
machine, and part I of polyalphabetic substitution
systems.

In a clearly written style, Nichols describes how to
solve each cipher, often with step-by-step examples,
using various techniques. These include position and
frequency tables, vowel selection method, pattern word
attack, consonant-line method, Phi test, Index of
Coincidence, probable words, anagraming, frequency
distribution data, and common digraphs, trigraphs
and tetragraphs for foreign languages, Kasiski method
for periodic ciphers, known word method, symmetry
principles and other techniques.

A minor criticism is the use of three chapters or 1/3 of
the book for Xenocrypts.  This is disproportionate by
any measure and additional editing and use of an
appendix for language data would provide a better
balance. Similarly, the Chapter on the German Enigma
stands out like plaintext in the middle of an encrypted
message. The information is interesting but out of
place; it belongs in an appendix.

Another criticism is the decision to have two volumes
instead of one, for no apparent reason. This will
require a second index and another list of references,
which adds to the basic inconvenience of having two
volumes when only one is necessary.


Despite these faults, Nichols has produced an out-
standing contribution to the literature of cryptology.
By way of comparison, in 1939, the American Cryptogram
association sponsored publication of Elementary Crypt-
analysis by Helen F. Gaines.  This was the first
comprehensive textbook on the subject published in the
United States and, almost 60 years later, it is still in
print because no other book has come close to its
standard. Now, however, Nichols' book, or at least the
first volume, compares favorably and in some ways is
even better!



REVIEW OF CLASSICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY COURSE, VOLUME I
By the Honorable David Kennedy, Director of Research,
NCSA.


     Classical Cryptography Course, Volume I.  By
Randall K. Nichols; published by Aegean Park Press,
(714) 586-8811 (phone) (714) 586-8269 (fax); (800) 736 -
3587; 301 pages (with index); $34.80 (American
Cryptogram Association members receive a 20% discount
through ACA or NCSA Members receive a 10% discount if
purchased from the NCSA Bookstore)

     In Classical Cryptography Course, Volume I, author
Randall K. Nichols has created a benchmark for serious
students of the science of cryptography.  This is a
text.  It is for learning, and with it one cannot help
but learn about the foundations of the science.  An
outgrowth of Nichols' admitted "labor of love" in the
online Cryptography Courses he teaches over the
Internet, Volume I creates the foundation for
understanding the development of the science.

     The ten chapters of this volume lead the student
through simple substitutions, substitutions with
variants, multiliteral substitutions, xenocrypts
(foreign language substitutions), cryptarithms, the
Enigma machine (separate Enigma95 program disk available
direct from the author) and finally to polyalphabetic
substitutions.  Seven chapters conclude with problems;
solutions and discussions are provided in an appendix.
The text is indexed with twenty-four pages of references
for further study.

     I found Nichols' sense of the history of
cryptography particularly noteworthy.  The volume is
liberally salted with citations from history with
applications of the methods developed in the text.  From
Revolutionary France through the American Civil War, the
Tammany Hall scandal, Revolutionary Soviet ciphers and
Japanese successes against Chinese codes prior to Pearl
Harbor, the text provides touchstones for student to
understand and relate to.

     Phil Zimmermann observed in the documentation to
his Pretty Good Privacy Program to "Beware of Snake
Oil." Among his arguments is this anecdote:

     I remember a conversation with Brian Snow, a highly
placed senior cryptographer with the NSA.  He said he
would never trust an encryption algorithm designed by
someone who had not "earned their bones" by first
spending a lot of time cracking codes.

     Where Schneier's Applied Cryptography is a crash
course in some encryption protocols and algorithms in
use today, Nichols' text begins the teaching of Snake
Oil detection and prevention.

     Learning the fundamentals, developed throughout the
text, brings a richer understanding of the science,
it's history and insight into it's possibilities and
some vulnerabilities lurking for the unwary.

     Nichols plans for release Volume II in the series
with advanced material on from the online course which
includes statistical attacks and transposition in
February, 1997.

Reviewer:  Dave Kennedy, CISSP, is Director of Research
for the National Computer Security Association,
Carlisle, PA.  He is a retired Army military police
officer and member of NCSA, ASIS, ISSA and the Computer
Security Institute.
