         HEADLINE PUZZLES, PLAYFAIR, FOURSQUARE
          FRACTIONATION AND DELASTELLE SYSTEMS


SUMMARY

I think this lecture is both interesting and perhaps
difficult.  We start off with PHOTON's Headliner Cipher
which combines many of the principles found in Lectures
1 and 10 - 12 of this course.   We then shift into
Digraphic systems with the Playfair and Foursquare
Ciphers.  We develop the theory of fractionation and
illustrate it with difficult classical systems known as
the Bifid and Trifid ciphers.  Both of these latter
cipher systems were invented by the French cryptographer
Delastelle. We develop our lecture with the help of the
following references: [ELCY], [BOW1], [BOW2], [BOW3],
[BOW4], [HITT], [LEWI], [NICH] and [PHOT].   At the end
of my lecture is a special note regarding Diophantine
equations, a subject which is a bit esoteric and has
interested several of our class.


HEADLINE PUZZLES (PHOTON)

Thirty years ago, Paul Derthick began publishing the
HEADLINE PUZZLE in the NSA monthly newsletter for
professional cryptologists. Paul is no longer with us,
but his puzzles continue to be written monthly by Larry
Gray to challenge and frustrate his successors.  We
thank PHOTON for exposing us to this wonderful cipher.
I have condensed his soon to be published paper.  [PHOT]

Headline Puzzles demonstrate a variety of cryptographic
principles.  Each puzzle contains five headlines from
recent daily newspapers. Each of the five is a different
monoalphabetic substitution, and all five are derived
from the same mixed alphabet at different settings
against itself. A complete solution includes recovering
the headlines, the key, the setting and the hat.





In Paul's words, "The use of headlines was a happily
malicious thought. It permits the inclusion of
outrageous proper names, and has the tendency to exclude
the commonest words." But even though the five headlines
may include some tough problems, finding the three words
(key, setting and hat) needed for a complete solution
may be even more challenging.

WALKING THROUGH A SOLUTION

The general outline of solution is to: 1) solve any two
headlines and use them to find a mixed alphabet that
solves all five headlines; 2) solve the rest of the
headlines and use all five to recover the setting; 3)
recover the key block and the sequence of transposition;
4) recover the original mixed alphabet by decimation;
and 5) finally, recover the hat (the word whose
alphabetic sequence of letters determines the
transposition sequence from the keyblock).


Step 1:SOLVE ANY TWO HEADLINES

Since the initial step is to solve any two headlines, we
look for nice wedges in any two. The first probable
wedges to catch my eye in this example are the long
pattern words in headlines 3 and 4. The 14 letter word
in headline 3.  has the pattern ABCDEFGHFIEFGJ, yielding
"counterfeiters" from the pattern word dictionary.
Substituting the letters in the headline produces a nice
wedge! Then a little trial and error produces, "Foreign
counterfeiters produce near-perfect hundred dollar
bills":

   LYQQFN  IJQQB

The 13 letter pattern word in headline 4. has the
pattern ABCDEFBGABHIJ, yielding "environmental" from the
pattern word dictionary. Substituting the letters in the
headline also produces a nice wedge; not as nice, but
good enough to produce "Budget cuts blamed for weak
environmental law enforcement":

Solving the first two headlines is seldom this easy; but
as you can see, long pattern words make nice wedges when
they are available. We assume that the reader knows how
to solve monoalphabetic ciphers with word divisions
(Aristocrats - see chapter 1 in [NICH]).

The current recovery of plain-text to cipher-text is:

                        Figure 17-1.


Step 2:FIND A MIXED ALPHABET THAT SOLVES ALL FIVE
HEADLINES

The columns in Figure 17-1 are arranged alphabetically
by the plain letters for ease in building chains. Each
vertical column is fixed, regardless of the sequence of
the columns because each plain letter stands for only
one cipher letter in each of the headlines. The purpose
of chaining is to find an alphabetic sequence for the
fixed columns that is the same in each row. The sequence
we derive from chaining will not necessarily be the
original mixed sequence; but it will solve all five
headlines when the rows are set against themselves.
For the rest of this section we will refer to the mixed
alphabet derived from chaining as an equivalent
alphabet.

Note that the equivalent alphabet is not unique. There
are 6 equivalent alphabets which are odd decimations of
the original (e.g.  every third letter, every fifth
letter etc.  in a 26 letter cycle), 6 odd decimations
that are the same as the first six, but in the reverse
order; 6 even decimations that give two cycles of
thirteen letters each (rather than a single cycle of 26
letters); 6 even decimations that are the same as the
first six even decimations, but reversed; and a single
decimation with the same two letters repeated 13
times. Only the 26-letter cycles are useful results from
chaining, so we will look only for odd decimations when
recovering the keyblock and the original mixed alphabet.


Chaining capitalizes on the symmetry of letter positions
in the fixed columns and their relative distances apart
in related alphabets. For example: if  plain A equals
cipher F in line 3, and plain F equals cipher W, then
the distance between plain A and plain F is the same as
the distance between cipher F and cipher W in their
respective alphabets.  A two-dimensional chain combines
the relationships of the  plain alphabet and two
different cipher alphabets.  In this example, we put
line 3. cipher-text letters vertically under the plain-
text letters; and put line 4. cipher-text letters
horizontally to the right of the plain-text letters. In
that way we generate a two-dimensional interactive chain
with the same equivalent alphabet in each vertical line,
and a different equivalent alphabet in each horizontal
line.  Please refer to Figures 17-2 and 17-3 for what
the display looks like on graph paper.

Arbitrarily starting with the plain A and cipher F (line
3) gives me part of the vertical chain (A over F ). Then
looking at plain F over cipher W adds W to the chain
(under the F).  Looking at plain W, however, shows that
no cipher letter has been identified in line 3 for plain
W, so we show "." as a place-filler. Returning to cipher
A (line 3), we find cipher A under plain E, but no
cipher E to continue the chain, so we show "." as a
place-filler. See the diagram in Figure 17-2 for the
vertical chain fragment EAFW.

Then we make a horizontal chain on each of the letters
of the vertical chain, using the plain alphabet and
cipher line 4.  The first horizontal line is from cipher
R to the right of plain E, cipher S to the right of
plain R, etc.  giving the horizontal chain fragment
ERSUOP.  Similarly, completing the next three horizontal
fragments looks like the matrix in Figure 17-2.

              .
            . E R S U O P .
      . K C D A N B X .
          . L F M I T H .
            . W G J .
              .

                       Figure 17-2

Continuing to expand the chains shows quickly that the
horizontal chain repeats with a 13 letter cycle,
indicating that it is from an even decimation (and
therefore not useful a this time). The vertical chain,
however, contains a full 26 letter mixed alphabet,
indicating a useful decimation. The result looks like
the matrix in Figure 17-3 after only a few iterations.

            I

                       Figure 17-3

Note how the chain fragments grow interactively, with
the horizontal chain providing letters for the vertical
chain and visa versa. Also note that all the vertical
segments are parts of the same equivalent alphabet. When
an overlap is discovered, the chain can be expanded by
inspection.  Look, for example, at the bottom vertical
segment NMGSBI and see how it came from combining
segments from the two columns to its right. Similarly,
the horizontal chain segments are, by chance, part of
two independent 13 letter cycles which can be expanded
to other horizontal chains by inspection.

Only one letter eluded detection by two-dimensional
chaining; so it isn't hard to identify it and fill in
the "Z".  There is no need to activate a third dimension
or solve another aristocrat in this example. We have
been able to find a complete 26-letter alphabet with
only two solved headlines in almost every case.  The
equivalent alphabet in this example is:


  I J U X T K O Y H C P V Z D L Q E A F W R N M G S B

Step 3: RECOVER THE SETTING AND THE INDEX LETTER

Any of the equivalent alphabets will solve the remainder
of the headlines, so we'll use this one instead of
waiting until recovery of the original alphabet. Now
that we have an alphabet to slide against itself, we
simply write out the alphabet on a sheet of graph paper,
and write it twice on a second sheet that we slide along
the first.  Then we attack the unsolved headlines at
their shortest (usually two letter) words.  Recognizing
that one of those letters will be a vowel, we simply try
all the vowels on one letter until the second letter
makes a good word.  Then we keep that slide position and
try another word to verify it.  R.  MASTERTON observes
another type wedge, in "Solving Cipher Problems"; "You
would be amazed at the number of times the second word
ends with S and the third is a short word such as TO."

Attacking  headline 1. with the slide setting in Figure
17-4  shows that LI = of  (verified with ZJL = two), and
the whole headline reads.  "Clinton condemns Cuban
downing of two civilian aircraft".

                       Figure 17-4


After applying the same technique to headlines 2 (SP =
of) and 5 (SI = to), the setting for each headline  is
shown in Figure 17-5. The setting word "SHARP" shows
clearly under the index letter "e". We'll need both the
setting and the index later.

     Setting = SHARP  Index = E



                       Figure 17-5

Note: The setting might read up the column, rather than
down, or be derived from plain-text alphabets under a
single cipher-text alphabet, rather than cipher-text
alphabets under a single plain-text alphabet.


Step 4:RECOVER THE KEY BLOCK

The literature suggests that we examine the equivalent
alphabet looking for sequences of letters (like ABC in
this example).  Then examine the alphabet to see if
another sequence is a uniform distance from each letter
(viz: L is 3 before A, M is 3 before B, O is 3 before C)
and decimate by the uniform distance. That works, but
it's not always obvious (to me). So we force the display
to show me sequences by aligning the equivalent alphabet
vertically in strips. For convenience we order them
across the middle in alphabetic sequence (similar to the
sequence of unused letters in a keyblock). Then the
appropriate decimation is much more obvious. See Figure
17-6.  Sometimes the key is in plain view. We made the
matrix in Figure 17-6. by hand the first couple of
times; and then wrote a short computer program to do the
drudgery.  The rows and columns are numbered for
convenience in referring to them.

Since we look for the key word and for alphabetic
sequences of unused letters in the key block, and for
them horizontally in Figure 17-6. The highest
concentration of alphabetic sequences are in rows -6, -
3, 3 and 6 indicating that a decimation of three might
be a good choice. We call this a goodness test in the
computer program; and it has always led me to the right
decimation.  The "goodness" column from PHOTON'S
computer program is merely the sum of alphabetically
adjacent letters in a horizontal row - indicating
likelihood of finding significant pieces of the unused
letters in a keyblock.

                        Figure 17-6

Note in column 1, for example, that the alphabetic
sequence reading up the column from the reference line
to -3 and -6 is ALV, and in column 2 it is BMW, and in
column 3 it is COX (all in alphabetic sequence).  So the
apparent order of the key block is up the columns. Since
we wrote the equivalent alphabets down the columns, the
decimation must be in the opposite (minus) direction.
Figure 17-7.  shows the likely keyblock lines arranging
from top to bottom for ease in reading.

In forming the keyblock, the columns must stay intact to
maintain the integrity of the mixed alphabet, but the
rows can be rearranged because the horizontal alphabetic
sequence was artificially created to get a sense of
order.  The key word will be on the top line of the
keyblock, perhaps wrapped around onto the second line.

Figure 8. shows the result of developing the keyblock
from the information in Figure 17-7. Look at line -3 in
Figure 17-7. and strike through the columns that were
not in alphabetical sequence (columns 5, 8, 9, 14, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, and 26). Then we looked at what remained
in row 3, and saw the word "zenith". Noticing that the
letter C was in the reference row under the Z in zenith,
Terminate the first row at B. The resulting perfect
keyblock confirms the decimation of minus three.

                       Figure 17-8



Step 5:RECOVER THE MIXED ALPHABET

The original alphabet in Figure 17-9 can now be read
directly from Figure 17-6 by starting with the index
letter "e" and reading every third letter vertically in
any column:

     E D P Y T J S N F Q Z C O X I G R A L V H K U B M W

                       Figure 17-9


Step 6:RECOVER THE HAT

Two essential elements are needed to recover the hat.
First, the transposition sequence of reading columns
from the keyblock. And second, the relationship between
the words used for the setting, the key and the hat. The
transposition sequence is the alphabetic sequence of
letters in the hat word. The relationship of the hat to
the setting and the key comes from your determination of
the relationship between the setting and the key alone.
The transposition sequence from the keyblock to the
mixed alphabet can be read directly.  From the original
alphabet in Figure 17-9,  refer to the keyblock in
Figure 17-8. Start with the index letter "E", read down
EDPY,  then down TJS, then down NFQ etc. The full
sequence is shown in Figure 17-10.

                     4 1 3 5 2 7 6 8
                     ---------------
                     Z E N I T H A B
                     C D F G J K L M
                     O P Q R S U V W
                     X Y



                      Figure 17-10

And now we know that the alphabetic sequence of letters
in the hat word is 4 1 3 5 2 7 6 8; and that the word is
related to the key word (ZENITH) and to the setting word
(SHARP).

There are at least two ways to find the hat. The method
illustrated in Figure 17-11 uses the alphabetic sequence
of each letter position in the hat and defines the
limits for each position. In the first text line of
Figure 17-11 the letter A could be at positions 1 and 2,
but not at the other position.  Only position 3 could
have a letter as low as B, positions 4, 5 and 7 could
have letters as low as C, depending on the letter in
position, positions 7 and 8 could have letters as
low as D, depending on the values above.  Likewise at
the high end, only positions 7 and 8 could have a letter
as high as Z etc.

                       4 1 3 5 2 7 6 8

In each of the HEADLINE PUZZLES,  research on the
relationships recovers the hat faster and with more
enjoyment than working the positional possibilities.
Relating the words SHARP and ZENITH suggests manu -
facturers of electronic stuff like computers and radios
and television sets. So we examined the names of other
manufacturers, like Toshiba, Panasonic, Motorola,
Magnavox, Pioneer, Hitachi etc.  only MAGNAVOX matches
the length and alphabetic sequence.  The name "HAT" came
from the position of the transcription word on top of
the keyblock.

DIGRAPHIC CIPHERS: PLAYFAIR

Perhaps the most famous cipher of 1943 involved the
future president of U.S., J. F. Kennedy, Jr. [KAHN]
On 2 August 1943, Australian Coastwatcher Lieutenant
Arthur Reginald Evans of the Royal Australian Naval
Volunteer Reserve saw a pinpoint of flame on the dark
waters of Blackett Strait from his jungle ridge on
Kolombangara Island, one of the Solomons. He did not
know that the Japanese destroyer Amagiri had rammed and
sliced in half an American patrol boat PT-109, under
the command of Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, United States
Naval Reserve.  Evans received the following message at
0930 on the morning of the 2 of August 1943:


      29gps

     KXJEY  UREBE  ZWEHE  WRYTU  HEYFS
     KREHE  GOYFI  WTTTU  OLKSY  CAJPO
     BOTEI  ZONTX  BYBWT  GONEY  CUZWR
     GDSON  SXBOU  YWRHE  BAAHY  USEDQ

                                  /0930/2

Translation:

     PT BOAT ONE ONE NINE LOST IN ACTION IN BLACKETT
     STRAIT TWO MILES SW MERESU COVE X CREW OF TWELVE
     X REQUEST ANY INFORMATION.

The coastwatchers regularly used the Playfair system.
Evans deciphered it with the key ROYAL NEW ZEALAND NAVY
and learned of Kennedy's fate. Evans reported back to
the coastwatcher near Munda, call sign PWD, that Object
still floating between Merusu and Gizo, and at 1:12 pm,
Evans was told by Coastwatcher KEN on Guadalcanal that
there was a possibility of survivors landing either on
Vangavanga or near islands.  That is what Kennedy and
his crew had done. They had swum to Plum Pudding Island
on the Southeastern tip of Gizo Island.

Several messages passed between PWD, KEN and GSE
(Evans). The Japanese made no attempt to capture Kennedy
even though they had access to the various messages. The
importance to them was missed even though many P-40's
were spotted in the Search and Rescue (SAR) attempt.
maybe the Japanese didn't want to waste the time or men
because the exact location of the crew was not
specified. A Japanese barge chugged past Kennedy's
hideout. On 0920 a.m. on Saturday morning 7 August 1943,
two natives found the sailors, who had moved to Gross
Island, and had reported to find Evans. He wrote a brief
message: Eleven survivors PT boat on Gross Is X Have
sent food and letter advising senior come here without
delay X Warn aviation of canoes crossing Ferguson RE.
The square Evans used was based on the key PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION :


               P H Y S I
               C A L E X
               M N T O B
               D F G K Q
               R U V W Z


The encipherment did not split the doubled letters as is
the rule:


     XELWA  OHWUW  YZMWI  HOMNE  OBTFW
     MSSPI  AJLUO  EAONG  OOFCM  FEXTT
     CWCFZ  YIPTF  EOBHM  WEMOC  SAWCZ
     SNYNW  MGXEL  HEZCU  FNZYL  NSBTB
     DANFK  OPEWM  SSHBK  GCWFV  EKMUE

There were 335 letters in 5 messages, in the same key
beginning XYAWO  GAOOA  GPEMO  HPQCW  IPNLG  RPIXL
TXLOA  NNYCS  YXBOY  MNBIN  YOBTY  QYNAI ..., for
Lieut. Kennedy considers it advisable that he pilot PT
boat tonight X ...  These five messages detailed the
rescue arrangements, which offered the Japanese a chance
to not only get the crew (and change all history!) and
the force coming out to save it. The Japanese failed to
solve what an experienced crypee could solve in one
hour. At 1000 hours that same day Kennedy and his crew
was rescued.


Digraphic substitution refers to the use of pairs of
letters to substitute for other pairs of letters. The
Playfair system was originated by the noted British
scientist, Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802 - 1875) but, as
far as known, it was not employed for military  or
diplomatic use during his lifetime. About 1890 it was
adopted for use by the British Foreign Office on the
recommendation of Lord Lyon Playfair (1818-1898) and
thereafter identified with its sponsor.

Encipherment

The Playfair is based on a 25 letter alphabet (omit J)
set up in a 5 X 5 square.  A keyword is written in
horizontally into the top rows of the square and the
remaining letters follow in regular order.  So for the
key = LOGARITHM, we have:


               L O G A R
               I T H M B
               C D E F K
               N P Q S U
               V W X Y Z


In preparation for encipherment, the plaintext is
separated into pairs. Doubled letters such as SS or NN
are separated by a null.

For example, "COME QUICKLY WE NEED HELP"  we have

       CO ME QU IC KL YW EN EX ED HE LP

There are three rules governing encipherment:

1.   When the two letters of a plain text pair are in
     the same column of the square, each is enciphered
     by the letter directly below it in that column. The
     letter at the bottom is enciphered by the letter at
     the top of the same column.

                  Plain       Cipher
                   OP           TW
                   IC           CN
                   EX           QG





2.   When the two letters of a plain text pair are in
     the same row of the square, each is enciphered by
     the letter directly to its right in that row.  The
     letter at the extreme right of the row is enciph-
     ered by the letter at the extreme left of the same
     row.


                     Plain       Cipher
                      YW           ZX
                      ED           FE
                      QU           SN


3.   When two letters are located in different rows and
     columns, they are enciphered by the two letters
     which form a rectangle with them, beginning with
     the letter in the SAME ROW with the first letter of
     the plaintext pair. (This occurs about 2/3 of the
     time.)

                     Plain       Cipher
                      CO           DL
                      ME           HF
                      KL           CR
                      LP           ON

Decipherment, when the keyword is known, is accomplished
by using the rules in reverse.

Identification Of The Playfair

The following features apply to the Playfair:

1. It is a substitution cipher.

2. The cipher message contains an even number of
   letters.

3. A frequency count will show no more than 25 letters.
   (The letter J is not found.)

4. If long repeats occur, they will be at irregular
   intervals.  In most cases, repeated sequences will be
   an even number of letters.

5. Many reversals of digraphs.


Peculiarities

1. No plaintext letter can be represented in the cipher
   by itself.

2. Any given letter can be represented by 5 other
   letters.


3. Any given letter can represent 5 other letters.

4. Any given letter cannot represent a letter that it
   combines with diagonally.

5. It is twice as probable that the two letters of any
   pair are at the corners of a rectangle, than as in
   the same row or column.

6. When a cipher letter has once been identified as a
   substitute for a plaintext letter, their is a 20%
   chance that it represents the same plaintext letter
   in each other appearance.

The goal of recovery of the 5 X 5 square and various
techniques for accomplishing this are the focus for
solving the Playfair.   Colonel Parker Hitt describes
Lieutenant Frank Moorman's approach to solving the
Playfair which addresses the keyword recovery logically.
[HITT].  Other writers [ELCY], [BOW2], [FRE4], and
[MAST] do an admirable job of discussing the process.
However, W. M. Bowers Volume I on Digraphic Substitution
presents the easiest protocol for students. [BOWE]


PLAYFAIR CRYPTANALYSIS

Our preliminary step is to perform individual letter
frequency and digraphic counts.  The former because high
frequency ciphertext letters follow closely the high
frequency letters they represent and will be located in
the upper rows; similarly, low frequency letters follow
their plain counterparts (UVWXYZ) and may be located at
the last row of the square.  A digraph count is useful
because cipher digraphs follow closely the frequency of
their plaintext digraphs. i.e. TH = HM. The frequency of
HM must be high for a normal length message. Also
tetragraphs may be tested THAT, TION, THIS for
corresponding their frequencies in the square.

All the authors agree that a probable word is need for
entry into the Playfair. Due to its inherent
characteristics, Playfair cipher words will follow the
same pattern as their plaintext equivalents; they carry
their pattern into the cipher.

only one combination of 1 and 3 will combine with the

We see that O is in the keyword, the sequence NPQ

Our plaintext message starts off: YOUNG RECRUIT DRIVER
ONE DAY ENTERED STORE ROOM ....


SERIATED PLAYFAIR

Perhaps the best known variation of the Playfair system,
and one which adds greatly to its security, is called
the Seriated Playfair.

The plain text is written horizontally in two line
periodic groups as shown below in period six


       C O M E Q U    E N E E D H    M E D I A T
       I C K L Y W   (X)E L P I M    E L Y T O M

The vertical pairs are formed and enciphered by the
regular Playfair rules. Based on the keyword LOGARITHM,
the above message is enciphered:





 L O G A R                  Cipher:
 I T H M B    N L B C S P   Q Q C D C M   H C F T R H
 C D E F K    C D F G X Z   G C G Q T B   F G W H G B
 N P Q S U
 V W X Y Z


we take the ciphertext off horizontally by the same
route by which the plain text was written in for
encipherment:

NLBCS  PCDFG  XZQQC  DCMGC  GQTBH  CFTRH  FGWHG  B.


Solution of Seriated Playfair:

We assume a period of 4 - 10 which fits most of the
cases encountered.  Of prime importance is determination
of the period. We test the various periods and eliminate
any test where we find a vertical pair consisting of two
appearances of the same letter.

If the message enciphered above is tested this way, in
all periods from 4 - 10, it will be found that period 6
is correct. All others will show a doubled vertical
pair.

Charles A. Leonard [PLAf] detailed a method to determine
impossible periods mathematically:


              S2
           -------    = Q & R
           S2 - S1


 where: S2 - S1 = Period, Q = quotient, R = remainder

 Substituting known S values in this formula and solving
for Q and R, a doubled vertical pair will occur in
period S2 - S1 in the following cases:

     1.  When Q is an odd number and R is greater than
         zero;
     2.  When Q is an even number and R is zero.

Cipher letter position numbers in our message are:

 A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   K   L    etc.
     3   4   8       9  10  25           2
    24   7  16      27  19  30
    36  15          31  21  34
        17              32
        20              35
        26



Period  Letter  S2 - S1     Q   R   Result
  4       F     31 - 27     7   3   Eliminated-Case 1
  5       C     20 - 15     4   0   Case 2
  6       C     26 - 20     4   2   possible
  7       H     34 - 30             Eliminate-last gp
  8       D     16 - 8      2   0   Case 2
  9       C     26 - 17     2   8   possible
          G     19 - 10     2   1   possible
          H     34 - 25     3   7   Case 1
  10      C     17 - 7      1   7   Case 1

When a periodic group S2 - S1 does not occur in message
the last group is inspected. If it is shorter than the
regular groups of the period being tested, a double
vertical pair may show at S2- S1 value equal to the
length of this final group. If so, eliminate.


The mono and digraphic frequency counts are made.
Plaintext high frequency digraphs and tetragraphs do not
carry their identity over into the cipher and are not
recognizable. Entry must be made with a probable word.
Patterns do carry over to the two line groups and will
repeat.

The placing of the probable word is important. Given a
cipher text slice with period 6 found using the Leonard
procedure:


   HKILVP   PBVBAA   BHRPOU   TBITFE   UCEVZK
   RNFTZU   HZWVFR   UDTKBD   UIBYNS   EXBZAR

and the probable phrase "is destined to", the word
destined could be in any of the following positions when
enciphered in period 6:


DESTIN  .DESTI   ..DEST   ...DES    ....DE
ED....  NED...   INED..   TINED.    STINED

The DE = ED reversal in all arrangements is noted and
found in the cipher text portion:

            BHRPOU   TBITFE   UCEVZK
            UDTKBD   UIBYNS   EXBZAR
                     .desti
                     ned..

adding the additional information:

            BHRPOU   TBITFE   UCEVZK
            UDTKBD   UIBYNS   EXBZAR

we develop several equations:

these translate to the following equalities:

After some work (and with some assumptions to be tested
we develop a tentative square for the system:

check:
TO=FN+   + = yes
SN=TU+
ST=TY+                        letters left: A C E G H K
I-=ES -=t  IT =ES                           L M P Q R V
DE=BI+                                      W X Z
ED=IB+

from here we need to expand on the cipher text or choose
another probable word.


DELASTELLE SYSTEMS - FOURSQUARE CIPHER

The enigmatic Frenchman, Felix Delastelle created
several nasty but very interesting cipher systems.
We will discuss three of his systems. They are the
Foursquare, Bifid, and Trifid.  [DELA]

The Four Square employs four 25-letter alphabets set up
in four 5 X 5 squares.  The alphabets in the upper left
and lower right squares are straight alphabets sans J.

Plaintext letters are found in these two alphabets when
the message is enciphered. The opposite squares are used
for ciphertext.

Encipherment follows only one rule. The plaintext
letters are divided into pairs. The first letter is
found in square 1, 2nd in square three. The two cells
are thought of as opposite corners of diagonals of an
imaginary rectangle.  The first cipher letter is found
in square 2 and the 2nd is found in square 4. The
operation continues until all letters are enciphered.

For example, given:


              1           2
          .....................
          A B C D E . G R D L U

          L M N O P . O A H P W
          Q R S T U . M B I Q X
          V W X Y Z . T C K S Z
          .....................
          L I C N V . A B C D E
          O T D P W . F G H I K

Identification of the Four Square

1. It is a substitution cipher.
2. It has an even number of letters.
3. Frequency count of 25 letters without J.
4. Doubled letters may occur eliminating a Playfair.
5. Long repeats occur at irregular intervals.  Even
   sequences are most frequent.
6. Few reversals in comparison to Playfair.





Peculiarities of the Four Square

1. A plaintext can be represented by itself in the
   cipher.
2. Any ciphertext letter can be represented by five
   letters.
3. Any given plaintext letter can be represented by five
   ciphertext letters.
4. A cipher letter can represent itself or the other
   letter of the pair.
5. Every cell frequency is known or can be calculated
   because of the straight alphabets.
6. The fixed locations of the letters in squares 1 and 3
   makes it possible to spot the location of probable
   words which form a pattern when enciphered by the
   Four Square.

Cell Frequencies

Bower and Meaker have derived the probabilities of the
normal ciphertext based on the normal distributions for
the straight alphabets in 1 and 3 based on 100
diagraphs.  [BOWE]

Bowers presents an interesting Four Square problem known
as the Stock Exchange Cipher. It supposedly is a message
to a broker. The investor sold 'rails' and probable
words such as Texas Eastern, Consolidated, and Columbia.

Observations

     1. Nulls are not required as in Playfair.
     2. Probable position of letters can be spotted
        through cell frequency.
     3. Probable words can be definitely placed if they
        produce a pattern.


There is no reason why all the squares can not be mixed
for additional security. This destroys the frequency
distribution attack; but digraphic and longer repeats
will still show through to the ciphertext. The most
reliable attack on the Four Square is via a probable
word.

DELASTELLE SYSTEMS - BIFID CIPHER

Friedman, Bowers and Lewis discuss the intricacies of
the Bifid cipher.  [FRE4], [BOWE], [MAST] You will find
many references to the Bifid cipher in the Cryptographic
Resources Section, many of them developed from ACA
materials.  Dr. Linz (LEDGE) covers the BIFID in some
detail. [LEDG]

The Bifid and Trifid ciphers represent a new and tougher
breed of classical cipher - Fractionated Ciphers. The
process of fractionation, whereby the substitute unit is
1/2 or 1/3 or 1/part for each letter represents a more
involved problem for analysis that some of the ciphers
presented to date.  What we do is combine substitution
and transposition processes to produce a clever mixed
cipher.  Modern ciphers do the same thing many times
over (called rounds or S-Boxes in DES).

Method of Encipherment By Bifid

The secretive Delastelle designed the Bifid to use a
checkerboard square with 25 letters, sans J.  We start
with a keyworded square:

                 1 2 3 4 5
               1 M A N Y O
               2 T H E R S
               3 B C D F G
               4 I K L P Q
               5 U V W X Z

Key = MANY OTHERS

The encipherment process is periodic and the number of
letters in each group is usually an odd number. Even
Bifids are actually easier to solve than odd. We will
focus on the odd Bifid to illustrate the process. Period
lengths of 7, 9, 11, or 13 are those most frequently
employed.




Encipherment is a combination of substitution and
transposition which is best shown by example.  We will
encipher the message COME QUICKLY WE NEED HELP in period
7.

Step 1: Period Length.

First divide the plaintext message into groups of 7
letters. Write the numerical equivalents for row and
column vertically under the plaintext letters.

     C O M E Q U I   C K L Y W E N   E E D H E L P
Row  3 1 1 2 4 5 2   3 4 4 1 5 2 1   2 2 3 2 2 4 4
Col  2 5 1 3 5 1 1   2 2 3 4 3 3 3   3 3 3 2 3 3 4

Step 2: Horizontal Transposition and Take Off

The next step is a form of transposition, wherein the
numerical substitutes are taken off horizontally by
pairs. In each individual group this take-off continues,
without interruption, through the two rows of numbers.
The last number of the top row pairs with the first
number of the bottom row. The first number of each
horizontal pair indicates the row of a cipher letter and
the second number of the pair indicates the column of
that cipher letter.

Step 3:

Find the cipher letters in the square using the new row
X column coordinates.


      Plain         C O M E Q U I
        Row         3 1 1 2 4 5 4
        Col         2 5 1 3 5 1 1
      Cipher        B A Q K U G M


31 = B; 12 = A; 45 = Q; 42 = K; 51= U; 35 = G; 11 =M


The process might be more clear if we look at the
encipherment this way:

              Row             Column

           B   A   Q    K    U   G   M

We see that cipher 'B"' has the same row 3 as 'C' row
and  'B' column (1) has the same number as O row (1).
This reasoning holds for the second and third cipher
letters 'A' and 'Q'.  The fourth cipher letter 'K' has
the same row (40 as plain 'I' and the same column number
(2) as plain 'C', which are the last and first letters
of the group. The fifth, sixth and seventh cipher
letters are derived the same way, except that we deal
with columns. The fifth cipher letter 'U', is the result
of 'U' row (5) and 'M' column (1).

Each cipher letter results from the some combination of
half values of the two plaintext letters. Due to this
characteristic, the Bifid (and Trifid with thirds) is
classified as Fractional Substitution.

Deciphering the Bifid with Known Elements:

Step 1: Fractionate the cipher letters into their row
and column components.

Step 2: Write into two rows horizontally of periodic
length.

Step 3: Write the numerical values into the two
horizontal rows below the fractionated letters.

Step 4: Recover Plain text letters vertically.

Identification of the Bifid

1. It is a substitution cipher with substitution units =
   to 1/2 of the cipher letter, represented by row or
   column index.

2. Frequency count of 25 letters (J omitted) but not
   more for 5 X 5 Bifid.  MASTERTON describes a 6 X 6
   Bifid with letters and symbols included. [LEWI]

3. Long repeats occur at irregular intervals.

4. Repeated patterns dependent upon the length of the
   repeated sequence and the period, ex.:

            AB .. D         A .. CD
            AB .. DE        AB . CD

5. A frequency count will show a flat profile compared
   to normal plaintext.

Peculiarities of the Bifid

1. When the cipher letters are set up in the correct
   period a few 'naturals' will occur. A natural  is the
   term for a vertical cipher pair, arranged row-column
   order, in which both components are the same letter.
   When this happens the plaintext letter is revealed.
   This is not true when the cipher letters are column-
   row unless the letter happens to be one of the five
   on the diagonal of the square running from 1-1 to
   5-5.

For:
                 1 2 3 4 5

         Hc Cr Cc Ar Ac
         --------------
Plain    H  E  A  T  H
         *

The first plaintext letter  H is a natural but the T on
the fourth is not.  The great majority of naturals will
be high frequency plaintext letters. If low frequency
plaintext letters appear as naturals, it is almost a
certainty that the cipher message is set up in an
incorrect period.

2. Half-naturals occur quite frequently, when the cipher
   is set up in the correct period. One of the letters
   of the vertical pair, in row-column order, is the
   same as the plaintext letter it represents.

The probability that one of the letters in row-column
pair is a half-natural is 8 in 25, or 32%  The
probability of a half-natural in column-row order (along
the diagonal) is 1/5 of 32% or 6.4%  Half naturals are a
function of the expected appearances of the plain text
letter. For instance, in a cipher of 100 letters, we
find 10 'E's and 10 'Z's.


    Cipher Letter E = 10 X 0.32 = 3.2 half-naturals
    Cipher Letter Z = 10 X 0.32 = 3.2 half-naturals

but the E is 13 times more likely than the Z. So the E
is expected to appear 13 times in 100 letters so the 3-4
half-naturals is possible but the Z will occur only 1
time in 100, so we may expect no half-naturals.


3. Half-naturals are the Bifid's most vulnerable
   feature because it plays a large part in spotting
   probable words.

4. The Bifid, fractionated for decipherment, engenders
   two separate and different alphabets. One applies to
   odd numbered vertical pairs, found in the basic
   square and the other applies to even vertical pairs
   in each periodic group.

5. Repeated plaintext sequences produce patterns as long
   as the repeat starts in the same relative location in
   the group as of its first appearance.

Cipher   B T A O V U F          H H M A E S N

The spacing for repeated cipher letters varies for
different periods. For four letter repeats it is:

             Odd                     Even
Period 5   T A . U                 M . S N
       7   T A . . U               M . . S N
       9   T A . . . U             M . . . S N
      11   T A . . . . U           M . . . . S N

Repeats of the other lengths generate their own
individual patterns. For period 7 these are:

                      Odd              Even
3 letter repeats   A . . . D         U . . X
4                  A B . . D         U . . X Y
5                  A B . . D E       U V . X Y
6                  A B C . D E       U V . X Y Z

The search for repeated patterns is the first step to
finding the correct period for solution of the Bifid.
Patterns are formed by plaintext components which serve
to make up complete cipher pairs. It does not make any
difference what letters may be in other places of the
group, the same patterns will always show for the word
in question, whenever it is enciphered in the same
period.  For example, for period 9:
            Odd                      Even
         1   3   5   7   9        2   4   6   8

THE THREE SQUARE TECHNIQUE

There are two basic ways to cryptanalyze the Bifid. One
involves placing of a probable word after determination
of the correct period and manipulating the rows and
columns of the Bifid decipherment square until it is
fully recovered or the keyword is found.  Friedman
discusses this method in detail. [FRE4] Bowers also
covers this approach but introduces the reader to a more
comfortable method for solution using the square itself
as a indicator of the letter indexes. Developed by
William A Lee (TONTO) in June, 1945, it uses three
squares to eliminate the requirement for numerical
indices.


The setup is as follows:


                         . . . . . . .
                         . E S C L V .   Top Square

Rules for encipherment and decipherment under three
square approach

We are always starting with fractions of two letters and
searching for the single letter that it represents by
these half values.

For encipherment, pairs will be fractionated like this:

          SrXr        SrXc       ScXc

For decipherment, the fractionated pairs will be:

                 SrXc        ScXr


1.  When one or both of the fractions is in the true
    position in a pair, it/they are found in the Basic
    Square.

                 SrXc  - both in basic
                 SrXr     S in basic
                 ScXc     X in basic

2.  When one of the fractional letters of the pair
    indicates that its row designates a column of the
    letter it is to represent, then it will be found in
    the top square.

                 SrXr -  X in top square
                 ScXr    X in top square

3.  When one of the fractional letters of the pair
    indicates that its column designates the row of the
    letter it is to represent, then it is found in the
    left square.

                 ScXc - S in left square
                 ScXr   S in left square

Using the word SOLVE we visualize:

                 Sr Or Lr Vr Er
                 Sc Oc Lc Vc Ec

                 ---   ----   -
                 S  O  L  V   E
                 -  ---   ----


SrOr - S row (basic); Orow as col (top),= M (basic)
LrVr -L row (basic); Vrow as col(top), =  R  "
ErSc -E row (basic); Scol (basic) =       E  "
OcLc- O col as row(left); L col (basic) = S  "
VcEc - Vcol as row(left);E col(basic) =   E  "

The same rules apply in reverse when the vertical pairs
are fractionated and the plain text equivalents are
found at the intersections.

CHI-SQUARE

Karl Pearson's Chi-Square test, which we described
previously, was adapted by D. Morgan in 1946 to
determine the period of a Bifid. Excluding middle
letters, letters fall into one of two families, the row
and column. Chi-Square tests the dissimilarity of
probable groups of different lengths. The periodic
length for which the difference is the greatest
represents the correct period. We calculate D**2/S,
where S equals the sum of the appearances in both row
and column families of any letter. D equals the
difference between the family appearances of any letter.

When D**2/S is calculated for every letter, these values
are summed and their sum is the Chi-Square value for
period under consideration.
If we were to find the following:


                 Period       Chi-Square
                   5            19.2
                   7            19.4
                   9            28.0
                  11            12.0

Our choice would be period 9.  Morgan's article in the
JJ 1946 Cryptogram details the procedure. [BIF3]

Lets try to solve an Odd period Bifid.

and the man who was Hitler's Chief of Intelligence
during WWII.

Inspection of this message reveals a repeat in the form
of A B . . . C D. This 5 letter repeat at the odd
position is in period 9. The fractionated cipher letters
would be located as shown, depending on the starting
position.

 1st position       3rd position       5th position
K K L L . . . . .  . . K K L L . . .  . . . . K K L L .
. E E A A . . . .  . . . E E A A . .  . . . . . E E A A
x x x x x              x x x x x              x x x x x

The first appearance of the repeat starts at letter 55
and the second at the letter 75.

                55 / 9 = 6 plus 1
                75 / 9 = 8 plus 3

Hence in period 9, the first repeat starts in group 7,
position 1 and the second in group 9, position 5.

We accept the period and rewrite the ciphertext. Using
the skip hit form of the three square, eliminate the
even vertical pairs, recognizing that they are column -
row pairs and that they may be visualized as a diagonal
from the top letter to next bottom letter in the two
rows.

When filling in the squares, we start with the even
numbered pairs to fill in the left and top squares
quickly. We then write in the known odd pairs. we write
the odd pairs into unallocated rows and columns and then
consolidate them.

Plaintext can be recovered which leads to new ciphertext
square letters being recovered. The phrase FOR NINE
YEARS at Groups 1 and 2; The Name HITLER in groups
17 and 18; the phrase FOR HITLERS THIRD REICH in groups
10-11-12.

The entire message can be read. The letters which fall
on the diagonal are known because they are repeated in
the left square in the same long row and in the top
square in the same long column. These letters can be
shifted along the diagonal, but cannot be moved away
from it. Doing so we have the enciphering square and the
true transposition that generated it.

The Even period Bifid is covered in copious detail in
Bowers. [BOWE]

DELASTELLE SYSTEMS - TRIFID CIPHER

Both Bowers and Linz covers the Trifid in detail. [BOW2]
[LEDG]  Bowers covers the Trifid in detail. Topics
include Keyword Block recovery, periodic group
structure, Trifid patterns, pattern uncertainty,
tetragraphic patterns and part naturals.

We know that P = n**r represents the permutations with
repetitions, n = number of different things, r = number
of things used at a time. The normal Bifid square shown
below, thought of as a 5 X 5 block with external
coordinates.


                     1 2 3 4 5
                   1 B I F D A
                   2 L P H E T
                   3 C G K M N
                   4 O Q R S U
                   5 V W X Y Z

But 5 x 5 block is also 5 x 5 = n**2, the right hand
portion of the formula. Look at it a new way:

    r=2
-----------------------------------------------------
Row     1         2         3         4         5
Col 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
    B I F D A L P H E T C G K M N O Q R S U V W X Y Z
-----------------------------------------------------
                   P = 25

In the case of the Trifid, the block takes the same form
with an additional dimension.

    r=3
-------------------------------------------------------
1         1                 2                 3
2   1     2     3     1     2     3     1     2     3
3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
  T R I F D A L P H B E C G J K M N O Q S U V W X Y Z #
-------------------------------------------------------
                   P = 27


I like to work with compact matrices so here is another
way to show the structure in three directions:

                    2nd Comp

                 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
                 -----------------
               1 T R I F D A L P H
   1st Comp    2 B E C G J K M N O
               3 Q S U V W X Y Z #
                 -----------------
                 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

                     3rd Comp

For the purpose of this lecture, the Trifid setup will
be shown as a 27 X 3 block containing all possible
changes in order of the three numbers 1-2-3, taken three
at a time and arranged in ascending order. The numbers
within the block, when read vertically, serve as
components of the letters of the alphabet which is
added, externally, to the block. So:


Comp
| T R I F D A L P H B E C G J K M N O Q S U V W X Y Z #
| -----------------------------------------------------
1|1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
2|1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
3|1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
 ------------------------------------------------------

The fact that 27 letters are required for the Trifid is
a weak feature of the system. we can use a ZA and ZB to
represent the 27 letter and the true Z respectively.
A scrambled alphabet is always used to prevent some
letters being represented all the time by the same
combination.   Based on keyword COUNTERSPY:


           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
           -------------------
           C O U N T E R S P Y
           A B D F G H I J K L
           M Q V W X Z #
           -------------------


The letters are taken off vertically in order of
columns. We set up two tables:

Method of Encipherment

Encipherment follows the same general pattern as the
Bifid. the plaintext is divided into groups of a chosen
periodic length and the numerical components are written
vertically below each letter. Periods of multiples of
3+1 are popular such 7 -10- 13 , with 10 being the most
popular. For example, with period = 10:

Plain     C O M E Q U I C K L|Y I N E E D H E L P
          -------------------|-------------------
          1 1 1.2 1 1.3 1 3.3|3 3 2.2 2 1.2 2 3.3
          1 2.1 3 2.3 1 1.3 3|3 1.1 3 3.3 3 3.3 2
          1.1 3 1.3 1 2.1 1 3|2.2 1 1.1 2 2.1 3 3
          ---------------------------------------
Cipher    C N # I D R K U I M|Y T X K V L J N B V

The first letter C is represented by vertical 111; plain
O by 121; M by 113; etc.

The first cipher letter C is derived by the horizontal
take off 111. The dot represents the break between
trigraphic units. Note that the C is derived from the
1st three components from COM. The fourth cipher letter
I derives from the first component of the tenth letter L
and the 2nd 2 components of CO. We go to the end of the
row and back to the first letter on the second row, to
the end and drop down to the third row first letter.

Decipherment

The decipherment process reverses that of encipherment,
in that the numerical components of the cipher letters
are written horizontally in three rows of periodic
length and are then read vertically to produce the
plaintext.
Identification of the Trifid

1. It is a substitution (fractionated) cipher with 27
   letters.

2. If long repeats occur, they will be at irregular
   intervals.

3. Repeated patterns will occur:

   for period 10:

       6 letters    A D . . C . . B . .
       5 letters    A . . . C . . B . .
       4 letters    A . . . . . . B . .

Peculiarities of the Trifid

1. Naturals, similar to those of the Bifid, are
   extremely rare.

2. Each plaintext letter can be represented by 729 (**3)
   different arrangements of fractions of itself and
   other letters.

3. The table of numerical components is inflexible. Any
   given digit - 1 - 2 -3 must appear 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
   component for nine letters - no more, no less.

4. Not more than three letters can have the same two
   components identical; and for these three letters the
   other component must be a different figure in each
   case.  This is a good rule for cryptanalysis.

5. Repeated plaintext sequences produce patterns that
   are recognizable. Bower devotes a substantial chapter
   to this rule. [BOWE]   The surest way to determine
   the period is through repeat patterns.

6. Repeated cipher patterns do not always represent the
   same plaintext letters. The period is key.


SOLUTION OF A TRIFID WHEN PLAINTEXT WORDS ARE GIVEN

Solution of a Trifid cipher requires that the individual
trio of numerical components having the correct
arrangement of the components must be determined for
each letter of the alphabet.  Sacco advises that a
probable word is essential. [SACC]

Given: Trifid, "The first" starts message and repeats at
RQOTUILR.

HRNGQ  SSXDI  TSIZB  BZBZB  TUPRE  IMQYS

BRWNO  VODZA  TAJVL  KKIVZ  A.

The triple repetition of ZB, in groups of three and
four. So set ZB = # and ZA = Z.  We place the tip and
repeat.

HRNGQ  SSXDI  TSI#  B##  TUPRE  IMQYS  BJPKV

KVRQO  TUILR  SIMK#  IRUXP  SOGWQ

We see a 6 letter repeat in period 10:

Letter 12:  S I # B # # T U P
Letter 41:  S I M K # I R U X
            * *     *     *

We accept the period as 10 and set up the message as
such.

An accepted method of setting-up a Trifid for solution
is to write the cipher message on quadrille paper
leaving a minimum of five blank rows between the lines
of letters. These are written horizontally in continuous
order, limiting the number of letters in each row to a
multiple of the periodic length.

We now fractionate the letters that we know to be
present and then set-up chains of equivalents. Like
Bifid, having two separate alphabets to contend with,
the Trifid has three separate alphabets to recovery
piece by piece. We must tabulate our known values.







The fractionated plaintext letters are to be vertically
aligned and the fractionated cipher letters must be in
horizontal alignment.

T1 H1 E1 F1 I1 R1 S1 T1 .  .
T2 H2 E2 F2 I2 R2 S2 T2 .  .
T3 H3 E3 F3 I3 R3 S3 T3 .  .

H1 H2 H3 R1 R2 R3 N1 N2 .  .
G2 G3 Q1 Q2 Q3 S1 S2 S3 .  .
S3 X1 X2 X3 D1 D2 D3 I1 .  .


.  .  K3 V1 V2 V3 R1 R2 R3 Q1
.  .  O1 O2 O3 T1 T2 T3 U1 U2
.  .  I2 I3 L1 L2 L3 R1 R2 R3


Set       Chain of Equivalents

(a)       T1 H1 K3 N2 Q1 Q2 F2 E2 O3 H2 V1 G3 O2

(b)       T2 G2 O1 S3 U2 Q3 I2 T3 I1 R3 R2 R1 D2 S1 D3
          N1 F1 V3

(c)       H3 X1 I3 E1 V2 D1 L3

(d)       E3 X2 L1

(e)       F3 X3 L2

(f)       S2 U1

All the above fractions are equivalent to each other.
There are six separate sets of equivalents, which means
three are duplicates and equal to each other. Set (a)
and (b) are not equal. The latter contains R1 R2 R3 and
Q3 ; while (a) contains Q2 Q3.  If both sets were equal
to each other they would violate the rule governing the
same identical numerical components, an impossible
condition.  We can give both sets numerical values of 1
and 2 arbitrarily, then check the assignment as we fill
in the holes.

        2     1       1       1   2 2 2 2   2
 ------------------------------------------------------





Having established a few values, set (c)  cannot have
the value 1 because rule 4 for E1 and V1. Also it cannot
have the value 2 because of a conflict with the letter D
=222 which is already in use by T.

We set (c) with a value of 3 and add the fractions to
our table.

                   Enciphering Table

       2     1 3 3   1 3     1   2 2 2 2   2
------------------------------------------------------

Further determinations are possible:

             O = 211 , F is 212 or 213
                       N is 212 or 213

Rule 4 prevents S2 to be 1 since FNO are 21.

S2 cannot be 2 because it conflicts with R ; S2 =3.

So the (f) takes on the value 3 and U1 = 3; F3 = 2 or 3;
D = 322 implies that U3 = 1 or 3. We set a decipher
table with known and derived values. Letters are added
externally.

We substitute know values in the message and recover

Group 12 and 13 gives us the word RIVERS, which yields
some new values.

We next look for the trigram THE.  We hit a possible
bonanza with groups 6,7, 9,11, 14, 17, 19, 21:

We are looking for the  1 1 3   components.
                        2 1 1

Group 7 tends to be the clincher with the words THE
DIFFERENCE.  We accept new values of B=131, C=332, P=
3??, Y=121 and W=1??.  The word BETWEEN is logical for
group 8. When placed we find G=321, P=313, W=133, Z=111.
Only a few letter components are unknown and they fall
when the known values are placed in the quadrille.

Keyword Recovery

A little inspection of the letters reveals that the take
off method is reverse and decimates as follows:

A C M U D G P X E J S K I R # N F O W V B L T Y H Q Z

    we see:

So we have just a small glimpse at the Trifid. Read Linz
and Bowers for a significantly better picture of this
cipher. There are whole issues surrounding period, part-
naturals, patterns and tetragraphic equivalents. [LEDG],
[BOWE]. The Resources section has many ACA articles
regarding the Trifid. Lastly, the reprints of three of
Delastelle's books are the most interesting (in French)
pertaining to the Trifid. Delastelle did not consider
the 27th letter an issue. (Maybe in French it was not.)

SPECIAL NOTE RE: DIOPHANTINE EQUATIONS
 
For some time now, Dr. Michael Anshel of CCNY and I have been
following the development of crypto from some early roots.
Here are short excerpts from our correspondence.  Jump in if
you can help us:

==============================================================

>From Michael to LANAKI:

Let me thank you for your very detailed answer. John
Wallis was involved in solving certain diophantine problems
particularly the Fermat-Pell equation, which in turn led to the
study on continued fractions, and ultimately to the study of
automatic sequences which are of interest to contemporary
cryptographers.  Were these very gifted 17th century
cryptographers aware of this possibility? - Michael Anshel.

===========================================================

To Michael from LANAKI:

In RE WALLIS:

"Arithimetica Infinitorium"  and Opera mathematica (Oxoniae,
1699), III 674,687,688,693 and 695 give solutions to
nomenclators based on pre-calculus theory.  Wallis' "Letter-
Book" gives some of his important papers (Smith op cit, p32,
p499)

Samuel Pepys Notes, Sir Christopher Wren's Discourses, Mr.
Robert Hookes' Diary, and Dr. William Holder's notes all praise
his mathematical ability and scholarly side but seem to put
Wallis as a "extremely greedy of glorie, steales feathers from
other to adorne his own cap."  They do not give us a clue as to
what Wallis might have in his hip pocket regarding diophantine
problems.

In RE DIOPHANTINE EQUATIONS:

I did find some interesting references on this subject in my
library.

=========================================

Further To Michael after intervening letters:

I have continued my search and found additional links in
history to answer your question:

DIOPHANTUS

Diophantus of Alexandria (ca. 250) wrote three works that
influenced greatly the later European number theorists.
"Arithmetica", (6 out of 13 extant), "On Polygonal Numbers",
(fragments survived), and "Porisms"  which was lost.
Translations of Arithmetica were made first by Xylander in 1575
[aka Dr.  Wilhelm Holtzman at the Univ. Heidelberg] and then by
Frenchman Bachet de Meziriac in 1621. A second carelessly
printed edition in 1670 became historically important because
it contained Fermat's famous marginal notes which stimulated
extensive number theory research.  Indeterminate algebraic
problems where one must find only the rational solutions were
named after him.  Modern usage implies the restriction to
integers.  Diophantus did not originate problems of this sort
but did originate the algebraic notation in the form of
stenographic abbreviations.

FERMAT

Fermat (1601 -1665), of his varied contributions to
mathematics, the most outstanding is the founding of the modern
theory of numbers.  He possessed nothing less than
extraordinary intuition.  Many of his contributions appear as
marginal notes in Bachet's translation, including his last
theorem that n>2 there do not exist positive integers x,y,z
such that x**n +y**n = z**n.  Fermat's famous "little theorem"
regarding primes was dictated to Frenicle de Bessey, dated Oct.
18, 1640. It was not proved until 1736 by Euler. By 1770,
Fermats theorems on prime numbers were proved by Euler and
Lagrange.

Gauss conjectured the prime number theorem (distribution of
primes) from both Fermat and Eulers work.  J.  H Rabin in 1659
published extensive factor tables for numbers up to 24,000 and
in 1668 John Pell of England extended the table up to 100,000.

WALLIS

Wallis (1616-1703) was Newtons predecessor.  His work with
conics in "Arithmetica Infinatorum" was hailed for more than a
century.  His "De algebra tractatus, historicus & practicus",
written in 1673 and published in 1685 was a serious attempt at
the history of mathematics in England.  Wallis edited parts of
famous Greek mathematicians works for the Royal Society - one
of which was our friend Diophantus.  His contributions to the
theory of integration are historic.

BARROW

Isaac Barrow ( 1630 - 1677) used Wallis' work to develop the
theory of differentiation.  He published his work in "Lectiones
Opticae et geometricae."  Wallis was a reviewer.

Newton (1642 - 1727) read Euclid's "Elements", Descartes' "La
Geometrie", Oughtred's "Clavis", works by Kepler and Viete and
the famous "Arithmetica infinitorum" by our boy Wallis.   From
his "Principia" has come much of our modern day math and
physics.

ROSSIGNOL

Rossignol (1600 -1682) may have been familiar with Rene
Descarte's ( 1596 - 1650) work on geometry and knew Pascal
(1623 - 1662) from court and was aware of Pascal's letter to
Fermat suggesting a solution to a problem proposed by Chevalier
de Mere regarding the theory behind gambling.  The
correspondence between Pascal and Fermat regarding the "problem
of points" laid the foundations of the science of probability.
Rossignol used this theory for his cryptographic finds.
Remember though it was the legendary William Friedman who did
the pioneering work in the statistical side of crypto in the
1930's.

CONCLUSION

This historical tour leads me to believe that Wallis was aware
of the preliminary implications of diophantine problems and
that Rossignol was aware of the potential of probability in
terms of cryptographic solutions.   Could they have seen beyond
the Fermat - Pell's work is difficult to prove.

>From Michael to LANAKI
Subj:  Diophantine revisited

There are several more threads in this search.  What needs to
be done is to trace back from contemporary (20th) century
researchers to see what lines of work emerged.  Lets see what
can be found regarding D. E. Littlewood the prominent British
mathematician and associate of G. H. Hardy and S. Ramanujan.
The nineteenth century had Charles Babbage.  The Willes family
was prominent over several centuries but I do not know if
Andrew Wiles is in this family tree.  Tracing the men (women)
and their methods around the Cambridge-Oxford researchers
should reveal new information.  Are their ACA members in
England who could help? - Michael

contacts. Amazing where the links of cryptography spread.
