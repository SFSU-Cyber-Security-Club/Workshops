             POLYALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION SYSTEMS II
                CRYPTANALYSIS OF VIGGY'S FAMILY



SUMMARY

In Lectures 11-12, we continue our course schedule with a study
of fascinating cipher systems known as the "Viggy" based on
multiple alphabets - Polyalphabetic Substitution systems.

We will continue developing our subject via an overview based
on the Op-20-GYT course notes (Office of Chief Of Naval
Operations, Washington) [OP20].  We will revisit polyalphabetic
cipher systems using Friedman's detailed analysis.  We will
cover the Viggy, Variant, PORTA systems and other family
members.  [FRE4], [FRE5], FRE6], [FRE7], [FRE8].  We will take
material from ACA's Practical Cryptanalysis Volume V by William
G. Bryan on "Periodic Ciphers - Miscellaneous: Volume II"
[BRYA] and Sinkov's [SINK] text to discover Viggy's secrets.
We will look at [ELCY's] treatment of these systems.

In Lecture 12, we will describe the difficult aperiodic
polyalphabetic case and give a diagram of topics considered in
Lectures 10 - 12.  [FR3]  We will complete the Viggy family.
I will also cover decimation processes in detail.

I have again updated our Resources Section with many references
on these systems - focusing on the cryptanalytic attack and
areas of historical interest.  Kahn has some wonderful stories
about the Viggy family. [KAHN]


ZEN CRYPTO

In Lectures 1- 10,  I have purposely stayed away from the
heavier mathematics of cryptography (subject to change).
Everything I am presenting can and has been reduced to
mathematical models and computerized for ease of work.  For my
readers who can not live without the math diet, there are
plenty of guru' s like [SCHN] and [SCH2] to have breakfast
with.  There are plenty of computer aids at the Crypto Drop Box
to help you do the setup work.





BUT those who embark on a course of 'only the computer' do this
without knowing the real effort -the brain power - the
shortcuts - the tradecraft - the historical implications,  in
my opinion, have lost the real heart of Cryptography.  The 'ah
ha's of inspiration are what make the difference.  First, there
is a fundamental problem in that computer models do not apply
to all variant cases.  Simple changes to the system can fool
even the most adept computer program.  For example, placing
clever nulls will defeat many a statistical based model.

Second, we lose the sense of urgency that was required for
wartime cryptography.  If President Kennedy's Playfair message
[ that's right it was not English as in the movie PT-109] on
the back of a coconut had been intercepted and deciphered by
the Japanese [which they very capable of doing], we might not
have had the graceful light of his Presidency or who knows the
moon landings.  As another case in point, the solution of
ENIGMA during the mid - final Atlantic Campaigns of World War
II, reduced the operational effectiveness of the U-Boat to one
day and hence saved allied tonnage and warships suppling
Europe.  The American and British Crypee's 'thought' more like
their German counterparts than their counterparts.  Computer
solutions were bulky, machine dependent [ the solution "stops"]
and not reliable until 1945.  People made the difference.


SOLVING A PERIODIC POLYALPHABETIC CIPHER

There are three fundamental steps to solve a Periodic cipher.

1) Determine the period.  This sets up the correct geometrical
   positioning of ciphertext alphabets.

2) Identify the Cipher System and reduce or consolidate the
   multiple alphabet distribution into a series of
   monoalphabetic frequency distributions.

3) Solve the monoalphabetic distributions by known principles.
   We have covered this in Lectures 1-3 and Lecture 10.

Friedman presents a more detailed and eloquent version of this
procedure in [FR7].

THE LONG AND SHORT OF KASISKI

Step one is finding the period.  Bryan reminds us that there
are at least two ways to find the period.  The short approach
makes use of the distances between patent cipher text
repetitions and factors the differentials.  The long approach
is used when there are no patent repetitions to factor.  In
this case we set up a possibilities matrix and factor every
combination looking for the highest probable common factor.
[BRYA]





As an example of the first case take:

          10            20            30            40

We tabulate the repetitions and the cipher text letter
differences between repetitions.

                             Suggest that the period is
                             either 5 or 10. Practice dictates
                             that the larger number is the
                             proper.

But suppose there are no repeats or those that do exist do not
establish a period. What then?

Now we take each difference and every difference in each case.
For example, A45-6, 83-6,89-6,92-6,115-6; and 83-45,89-45,92-
45,115-45; and 89-83,92-83,115-83; and 92-89,115-89, and 115-
92.  Then we factor these differences, setting up a matrix
(Table 11-1) of potential periods from 3 -12 inclusive and
total the tabulations for each factor in each of the letters of
the alphabet.  The highest column total represents the period.
The number is correct more than 98 per cent of the time.

The period is 7.


WHAT CIPHERS MAKE UP THE VIGGY FAMILY?

The Viggy (or more correctly the Vigenere) Family is group of
ciphers.  Included in this group are: Vigenere, Variant,
Beaufort, Gronsfeld, Porta, Portax, and Quagmires I-IV.
Other ciphers may be included in the group.  They are Nihilist
Substitution, Auto - Key, Running Key and Interrupted ciphers.
Bryan includes the Tri-square, the periodic Fractionated
Morse, the Seriated Playfair and the Homophonic in the same
class of ciphers.

These ciphers were invented at different times by different
authors, sometimes with confusion of authorship, and in
different countries.  They are similar in that they represent
permutations of the same cryptographic concept and can be
cracked with the same general methodology, albeit with slight
variations in procedure.  What is also interesting is that
these ciphers can be viewed in tableaux form, in slide form or
matrix form.

The theory of polyalphabetic substitution is simple. The
encipherer has at his disposal several simple substitution
alphabets, usually 26.  He uses one such alphabet to encipher
only one letter, another alphabet for the second letter,
and so forth, until some preconcerted plan has been followed.
The earliest known ciphers of this kind, the Porta (1563), the
Vigenere (1586) used tableau's for encipherment, in which all
the alphabets were written out in full below each other. The
Gronsfield (1655) had a mental key, and the Beaufort (1857)
which came two hundred years later, again used the tableaux.
The process was reduced to strips or slides in 1880 at the
French military academy of Saint-Cyr.  The polyalphabetic
deciphering slides now bear that name.   [ELCY]

To know thoroughly any of these ciphers is to understand the
fundamental principles of all.  Lets look at the papa bear.



THE VIGENERE CIPHER

The father of the Viggy family is the Vigenere Cipher.  Like
most of the periodic ciphers, the 'Viggy' is actually a series
of monoalphabetic substitutions such as Aristocrats, and since
a keyword is used, under each letter of the keyword, there is a
separate simple substitution cipher - each one different- ,
using all the letters, in such a manner, that the resulting
cipher is a combination of several such substitutions.

Attributed to Blaise de Vigenere, the cipher named for him was
invented by him in 1586.  In his "Traicte des Chiffres"
he did invent an autokey system which used both a priming key
and did not recommence his plaintext key with each word, nut
kept it running continuously.  He described a second autokey
system which was more open but still secure.  Both systems were
forgotten and were re-invented in the 19th century.  Historians
have credited Vigenere with the simpler polyalphabetic
substitution system.  Legend grew around this cipher that it
was "impossible of translation" as late as 1917. [KAHN]

The original Viggy was composed of an enciphering and
deciphering tableaux.  Letters were enciphered and deciphered
one letter at a time.  The modern Vigenere tableaux is
shown in Figure 11-1.

The normal alphabet at the top of the tableaux is for plaintext
and the keyletters are shown at the extreme left under the 'A'
of the top row.  Where the two lines intersect in the body of
Figure 11-1, the ciphertext is found.

For example using the keyword TENT, we encipher "COME AT ONCE"

we have: TENT       TENT
         ----       ----
         COME       VSZX   (ciphertext)
         ATON       TXBG
         CE         VI--


The enciphering and deciphering problem are done as a group of
letters to improve speed and accuracy of the process.

Another way to look at this is that the Viggy is really a two
dimensional slide problem.  We can construct (or purchase for
about $2.00 from ACA) a set of two Saint-Cyr slides that
operate the same way as the tableaux shown in Figure 11-1.
What is useful is that each slide bears the standard normal
alphabet from A-Z with high frequency letters colored or
shaded.  Each slide is a double-alphabet to allow flexibility.

                          Figure 11-2

   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
   GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEF
   *                         *

Figure 2 shows the Saint- Cyr slide at a key of G.  Check with
Figure 11-1 to see that the results are the same for Nplain =
Tcipher or Iplain = Ocipher.

The practical use of the Saint Cyr slide is that the whole
column of plaintext is enciphered as a unit.  So C A C would be
enciphered as V A V, plaintext O T E becomes S X I, etc.
This eliminates mistakes.   The cipher is taken off in 5 letter
groups by rows, so we would have VSZXT XBGVI for our previous
example.

Friedman points out that the sliding components produce the
same type of cipher with the circular disks like the old U. S.
Army version.  [FRE7]

Koblitz [KOBL]  describes the Viggy as follows:

For some fixed k, regard blocks of k letters as vectors in
(Z/NZ)**k. Where N is the N-letter alphabet and a digraph
integer correspondence exists between modulo N**2 array
and it is a vector mapping.  Choose some fixed vector b
which exists in the plane (Z/NZ)**k which can be remembered
by a key word and encipher by means of the vector translation
C = P +b where C is the ciphertext message unit and P is the
plaintext message unit which is a k-tuple of the integers
modulo N.

The object is to guess N and k, break up the ciphertext in
blocks of k letters and performs a frequency analysis on the
first letter of each block to determine the first component of
b and then proceeds onto the second letter
in the block, etc.

Konheim's description is worse than Koblitz's. [KONH]

Seberry and Pieprzyk describe the Viggy as made up of
key sequence k= k1...kd where ki , (i=1,d) gives the amount of
shift in the ith alphabet, fi(a) = a+ki(mod n) and the
ciphertext is described as fi**(-1) = (ki -c) mod n so that

fi(a) = [(n-1)-a +(ki +1) ] mod n             [SEAB]


The latter four descriptions are boring - even to my
engineering background.  They also do not hold water for
randomized alphabets or tableauxs with disruption areas in
place.  These represent discontinuities in the mathematical
function.  They are discontinuous and tractable.  Or
differentiable if the model is such.  SCYER's program may have
solved the discontinuity integer problem by area limits or
module limits.   When he publishes the procedure, maybe he will
tell us.


WHICH WAY ?

Does it matter with the Viggy,  that we encipher S by B (B
alphabet or Key B) to find cipher T or encipher B by S (S
alphabet or Key S) to find T?  No. This is an interesting
characteristic not shared by all in the Viggy family.  It may
be its downfall.

For instance, the message:

  Send Supplies To Morley's Station

enciphered with the repeating key, BED under the original
method of encipherment as might be described by Blaise de
Vigenere would be:




Key   : BEDB  EDBEDBED  BE  DBEDBED  BEDBEDB
Plain : SEND  SUPPLIES  TO  MORLEYS  STATION
Cipher: TIQE  WXQTOJIV  US  PPVOFCV  TXDUMRO









The modern Saint-Cyr slide encipherment of the above would be:

  Key        B E D     B E D     B E D
  Plain      S E N     D S U     P P L
  Cipher     T I Q     E W X     Q T O

             I E S     T O M     O R L
             J I V     U S P     P V O

             E Y S     S T A     T I O
             F C V     T X D     U M R

             N
             O

which gives:

        5         10          15          20          25
T I Q E W   X Q T O J   I V U S P   P V O F C   V T X D U

      30
M R O X X    (two ending nulls and a bad choice at that)


With the Saint Cyr slide, we would encipher S, I, E, N; then
D, T, S, and finally P, O , T by setting the B key on the
bottom slide under the A key of the top slide and reading off
the equivalents.                            [SINK], [ELCY]


DECIPHERMENT BY PROBABLE WORD

Refer to Figure 11-3:


                     Figure 11-3



Deciphering with the Key:

Key   :  B E D B E D B E D B E D  ........
Cipher:  T I Q E W X Q T O J I V  ........
Plain :  S E N D S U P P L I E S  ........


Deciphering with the Message:

Plain :  S E N D S U P P L I E S  ........  (trial key)
Cipher:  T I Q E W X Q T O J I V  ........
Key   :  B E D B E D B E D B E D  ........  (true  key)

Figure 11-3 indicates a possible solution method.  The message
fragment works well as a trial key, and if applied in the
same manner as the true key, the true original key will be
revealed.  The Vigenere Cipher works equally well in reverse.
It is this peculiarity that portends the use of a probable word
attack.


Suppose we have the cryptogram:


   U S Z H L    W D B P B    G G F S ...


which we suspect that the presence of the word SUPPLIES.
We decipher the first 8 letters using this probable word as a
trial key, and obtain the jumbled series: C Y K S A O Z J,

which is unsatisfactory.  We next drop the first U, and obtain
group  : A F S W L V X X.  We fail again on the third and
fourth trials.  The fifth decipherment obtains the series
TCOMETCO.  We see the TCO repeats and the key word COMET.
[ELCY]

F. R. Carter of the ACA shows us a more organized approach in
Figure 11-4:

Look down at an angle between the stars to find the key word
COMET.  The first letter S was used to decipher every possible
key letter which can produce S.  The entire row of equivalents
were produced at the same time.  The resulting rows of
decipherment indicate all the possible keyletters that could
produce S, then U, then P, and so on.   Carter actually
shortened the procedure to three full rows and then partials
thereafter.  He assumes that the keyword is readable and
discards non readable text.


DECIPHERMENT BY PROBABLE TRIGRAM SEQUENCE

For the case where we have no probable word or the sequence is
very short, we may use Ohaver's Trigram Method.  We start with
a list of usual trigrams THE, AND, THA, ENT, ION, TIO.  The key
fragments deciphered by these will be short and numerous, some
correct and some incorrect to bring out the repeating key
sequence.  A secondary worksheet is used to test the various
fragments as keys.  If any one of them is a fragment of the
original key, it must bring out fragments of plaintext at
regular intervals.

A scheme like Carters can be used with the trigrams THE, AND..
replacing the word SUPPLIES.   Refer to Figure 11-5.

Given:
                   10                    20              26
  L N F V E  O L N V M  R N G Q F  H H R N H  I R V F E  B


The cipher text is only 26 letters long.  Every letter except
the final two might begin a cipher trigram.  So we have 24
cipher trigrams.  Write them out in full on two worksheets.

Trial 1 tests for THA, THE, AND fail but ION gives us FRI and
WAY. But anyone of these 24 decipherments on the second row
might be a fragment of the original key.  Trial 2 fails to
confirm FRI or WAY but test of key-fragment EDA yields ION.
If this sequence is actually a portion of the original key,
then the plaintext will be brought out at some constant
distance apart.  The point we found the trigram is the tenth
cryptogram letter; that is every trigram presents only one new
letter so to find a completely different trigram in either
direction, we must count backwards or forwards a distance of
three trigrams.

Beginning at the tenth trigram we examine every third trigram
in both directions.  The following is found: HKF, RBO, HKV,ION,
CNF, DER,JEI, NSF.  These are incoherent. This would be
equivalent to a period of three - not likely.  Try every fourth
decipherment: JCV,KIN,ION,MCH,NKH,NSF. Not usable for a
consecutive sequence, continuously written cryptogram.
Trying the decipherments at a proposed period of 5, we get ALL,
ION, BEH, DFR.  This possibility is good.  We try to
decipher the T before ION and get the letter C.  We now have
four letters in our key C E D A.  With a little anagraming we
have the word D A * C E.  A probable word FRIDAY comes to mind.


BRYAN'S SAINT-CYR 'HITS' METHOD

William G. Bryan shows us how to use the high frequency letters
on the Saint-Cyr slide to good use.

Given the Viggy with a known period of 7 based on a similar
effort used in Table 11-1:

RGPHQ  WIIBL  XQXMM  TDVGU  EITFM  QEEJH  WUHFW.

We reset the problem in groups of 7:

              1234567
              PXIZHGV
              GEUUOXI

Now each column represents a separate simple substitution
cipher.  They will not produce consecutive plaintext, but
merely show isolated letters in that particular substitution,
to be coupled with those letters that fall on either side in
other substitutions, to make a true plain text sequence. Here's
where the underlined high-frequency letters on the slide come
in:

We go down column 1 and tabulate all the letters which
appear\more than once. P-2, G-2, X-2, C-2, I-3, T-2. We
rearrange them in their normal sequence = C G I P T X.
The lower slide is moved successively so that the first letter
C is under the high frequency letters, in turn, A E H I N O R S
T, and a reading is made of the number of 'hits' , the number
of other cipher text letters G I P T X that fall below the high
frequency letters.  If they do then the letter under A of the
top slide is the key letter for that column.  If they don't
further trials are necessary.


High frequency letters don't always show up. Some times medium
frequency letters may be required.  So with C under A: G-E, I-
G,P-N, T-R, X-V; With C under E:G-I, I-K, P-R, T-V, X-Z; With C
under the H: G-L, I-N, P-U, T-Y, X-C; with C under the I: G-
M,I-O,P-V, T-Z, X-D; and with C under the N: G-R, I-t, P -A, T-
E, X-I (six hits); and we have found the setting. So we set P
under the A in the top slide, and decipher the entire column A
R I N N T H I A T T C D R, and write it into a blank column as
column 1.

Proceeding with Column 2, we have no results. Column shows 2
passable results at P and U, Column 4 seems to go with Y,
column 5, setting B has 4 hits, Column 6 has 5 hits indicating
an E, and Column 7, R gives six hits.

The keyword thus recovered is P P Y B E R.  We choose to
decipher the ending B E R as the ending of a keyword to
produce:

                 B E R
                 -----
                 G C E
                 N T R
                 O F I
                 N S I
                 S K A
                 G H T
                 R E M
                 A N T
                 O N S
                 L Y A
                 T H E
                 U R E
                 E N A
                 V E R
                 W I V
                 T A R
                 D A S
                 E S -

These are almost all good fragments.  The GHT must have an I or
U before it.  Since cipher letter G is involved, we place the G
under the I which results in the Y we already had and putting G
under the U gives us M under the A, we choose the latter.

Now we have  MBER has a key fragment.  Deciphering column 4
with M adds N I I S A A U A T C T R T M E E U E V to the
evidence.

There are several possibilities NGCE preceded by an O, UGHT
preceded by an O, TANT preceded by an OR;  TLYA preceded by an
N; UTAR preceded by an  O or A; and EWIV preceded by R/H.

With the Viggy cipher, remember to read the setting for the
keyword letter below the A of the Stationary slide; and the
plain text appears on the same slide as this A, while the
cipher text is in the lower slide.



VIGENERE COMPUTER SOLUTION IS QUICKER

At this juncture, I wondered how our Viggy solver at the CDB
would do on this problem.  I brought up my faithful computer
program and entered the cipher text into Vigenere.exe without
telling it the period and found the following:

The period was found within 1 second.  The trial keyword
was PLQMBER, which I assumed was PLUMBER.  Using PLUMBER as my
keyword,  it typed out the answer: "AMONG CERTAIN TRIBES OF
INDIANS IN ALASKA.. ends BUT ARE USED AS SLAVES."  The process
took less than 3 seconds of compute time on my 486/50.

I then rearranged the ciphertext with five nulls strategically
added.  The next pass gave me a period of nine and a gibberish
trial keyword.  So for well defined problems the computer is
less fun but a clear winner.  For the clever cryptographer,
the computer can be defeated.


PRIMARY COMPONENTS

We have seen that equivalents obtainable from use of square
tables may be duplicated by slides or revolving disks [FR2],
[FR7] or computer models.  Cryptographically, the results may
be quite diverse from different methods of using such
paraphenalia, since the specific equivalents obtained from one
method may be altogether different from those obtained from
another method.  But from the cryptanalytic point of view the
diversity referred to is of little significance.

There are, not two, but four letters involved in every case of
finding equivalents by means of sliding components;
furthermore, the determination of an equivalent for a given
plaintext letter is represented by two equations involving four
equally important elements, usually letters.

Consider this juxtaposition:


1.  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
2.  F B P Y R C Q Z I G S E H T D J U M K V A L W N O X

Question - what is the equivalent of Pplain when the Key letter
is K?  Answer - without further specification, the cipher
equivalent can not be stated.  Which letter do we set K against
and in which alphabet?  We have previously assumed that the K
cipher would be put against A in the plain. But this is only a
convention.







                       Figure 11-6

                          Key              Cipher


With this setting Pplain = Zcipher.


The four elements are:

1.  The Key letter, 0k
2.  The index letter, 01
3.  The plaintext letter, 0p
4.  The cipher letter. 0c

The index letter is commonly the initial letter of the
component, but by convention only.  We will assume from now on
that 01 is the initial letter of the component in which it is
located.  Refer to Figure 11-6 to confirm this assumption.
The enciphering equations above are:

                (I) Kk = A1 ; Pp = Zc     k=key, p=plain,
                                          c=cipher, 1= initial

There is nothing sacred about the sliding components. Consider
Figure 11-6b.


                      Figure 11-6b


                         Index            Cipher

                         Key              Plain


thus           (II) Kk = A1; Pp = Kc

Since equations (I) and (II) yield different results even with
the same index, key and plain text letters, it is obvious that
a more precise formula is required.  Adding locations to these
equations does the trick.

(I)  Kk in component (2) =A1 in component (1); Pp in component
     (1) = Zc in component (2).

(II) Kk in component (2) =A1 in component (1); Pp in component
     (2) = Zc in component (1).

In shorthand notation:

          (1)  Kk/2 = A1/1; Pp/1 + Zc/2
          (2)  Kk/2 = A1/1; Pp/2 + Zc/1

Employing two sliding components and four letters implies
twelve different resulting systems for the same set of
components and twelve enciphering conditions.  These
constitute the Viggy Family:

                           Table 11-2


(1) 0k/2=01/1; 0p/1=0c/2        (7)  0k/2=0p/1; 01/2=0c/1
(2) 0k/2=01/1; 0p/2=0c/1        (8)  0k/2=0c/1; 01/2=0p/1
(3) 0k/1=01/2; 0p/1=0c/2        (9)  0k/1=0p/2; 01/1=0c/2
(4) 0k/1=01/2; 0p/2=0c/1        (10) 0k/1=0c/2; 01/1=0p/2
(5) 0k/2=0p/1; 01/1=0c/2        (11) 0k/1=0p/2; 01/2=0c/1
(6) 0k/2=0c/1; 0p/1=0p/2        (12) 0k/1=0c/2; 01/2=0p/1


The first two equations (1) and (2) define the Vigenere type of
encipherment and are widely used.  Equations (5) and (6) define
the Beauford type and Equations (9) and (10) define the
Delastelle type of encipherment.  [FR7]


FURTHER REMARKS ON REPETITIONS

I have said that the three steps in the cryptanalysis of
repeating key systems are : 1) Find the length of the period,
2) Allocate or distribute the letters of the ciphertext into
their respective alphabets, thereby reducing the polyalphabetic
text to monoalphabetic terms, and 3) analysis of the individual
monoalphabetic distributions to determine the plain text values
of their cipher equivalents in each distribution or alphabet.

As a direct result of using a repeating key (no matter how
long) certain phenomena are manifested externally to the
cryptogram.  Regardless of what system is used, identical plain
text letters enciphered by the same cipher alphabet with single
equivalents must yield identical cipher letters.  This happens
each time the same key letter is used to encipher identical
plaintext letters.

Since the number of columns or positions with respect to the
key are limited, and there is a normal redundancy in the
language, it follows that there will be in a message of fair
length many cases where identical plain text letters must fall
into the same column.  This will be enciphered by the same
cipher alphabet, resulting in many repetitions.  There are two
types of repetitions: causal and accidental (random)
repetitions.  The former we can trace back to the key. The
latter occurs when different plaintext letters fall in
different columns and by chance produce identical cipher text
letters.


Accidental repetitions will occur frequently with individual
letters, less frequently with digraphs (because the accident
must occur twice in succession, much less in the case of
trigraphs and very much less in the case of a tetragraph.
The probability of chance repetition decreases significantly as
the repetition increases in length.  Friedman has developed
statistical tables based on the binomial and Poisson
distributions to determine the individual and cumulative
probabilities for expected number of repetitions in n letter
text to occur x or more times in samples of random text.

The use of these tables is important.  They tell us when
we are dealing with cryptographically maneuvered text versus
random noise designed to fool the listener.  They indicate
what may be a hoax (Beale or Bacon - Shakespeare controversies)
versus valid enciphered text.

Tables 11-3 to 11-6 show the above theory.

By way of illustration, of the use of these tables, from Table
11-3, we obseve that in a sample of 300 letters of random text,
we may expect 43 digraphs to occur twice, 6 digraphs to occur
three times and 1 digraph to occur four times.  If we sum the
values under E(2) through E(6) we have the cumulative
probability in the 300 letter sample.  The sum is 49.477, which
indicates that in a sample of 300 letters or so, 49 digraphs
will occur two or more times.


STATISTICAL PROOF OF THE MONOALPHABETICITY OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS

The second step in the solution of periodic ciphers is to
distribute the cipher text into the component monoalphabets.
The period once established tells us the number of cipher
alphabets.  By rewriting the message in groups corresponding to
the length of the key (period) in columnar fashion,  we
automatically have divided up the text so that letters
belonging to the same cipher alphabet occupy similar positions
in the groups or in the same columns.


If we make separate uniliteral frequency distributions for the
isolated alphabets, each of these resulting distributions is
therefore, a monoalphabetic frequency distribution.  Were this
not so, if they did not have the characteristic crest and
trough appearance including the expected number of blanks,
if the observed values of Phi are not sufficiently close to the
expected value of Phi plain, or do not yield I.C.'s in the
close vicinity of the expected value, then the entire analysis
is fallacious.

The I.C. values of these individual distributions may be
considered an index of correctness of the factoring process.
Both theoretically and practically, the correct hypothesis with
respect to these distributions will tend to conform more
closely to the expected I.C. of a monoalphabetic frequency
distribution.


Friedman demonstrates the above with an example:    [FR7]

Friedman gives a useful formula for monographic I.C. of a 26

    I.C.  =  26 sum f(f-1)/N(N-1) = Phi(o) / Phi (r)

and 1.0 for random text.  We may apply the I.C. test to the
distributions of periodic polyalphabetic  ciphers to confirm
the monoalphabeticity of their character.  This also confirms
the period length and correctness.  if the correct period is
assumed, then the Phi test applied to each of the alphabets
should approximate closely and consistently the value of Phi(p)
and conversely, if the incorrect period is assumed, then the
Phi(o) should approximate the value of Phi(r).  Deviation from
this hypothesis must be statistically significant.  [FR7]

So we break down the four alphabets:

  4 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 3     1   1 1     1 1 4      Phi =42
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  I.C.=1.68

1   2   4   1         2 1     4     4 1     1 2 2 Phi=44
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  I.C.=1.91

1   5     1   1 1 1   5 2 1     1       2 1   1 2 Phi=46
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  I.C.=1.99

    1   6   2   2 1     1   1 1   2 2     1 1 3 1 Phi=44
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  I.C.=1.91


It is seen that all these distributions are monoalphabetic
since their observed Phi's are closer to the Phi (p) = 40.
rather than Phi (r) = 23.  Any other period assumed at four
or a multiple of four, will not yield monoalphabetic
distributions.

In light of the foregoing principles, we now look at two
additional cryptanalytic techniques for the Viggy family.
The first compares the distributions to the normal and the
second is very important - completing the plain-component.


SOLUTION BY FITTING THE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE NORMAL

Given message text A:

           5         10         15         20         25

K.  N L M D F  A A E X I  J L U F M  P Z J N V  C A I G I
L.  U A W P R  N V I W E  J K Z A S  Z L A F M  H S

The period is 5 and the I.C. confirms this hypothesis.

We make uniliteral frequency distributions for the 5 alphabets
to determine if we have standard alphabets.


Alphabet 1     I.C. = 1.44
5 1 2 3 3   3 2 2 6 2 1   6 1 5 3   1   2   1     6

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z


Except for possibly Alphabet 1, all are standard distributions.
It is clear that the Aplain for  alphabets 2,3,4,5 are H,I,T,E
cipher.  A little experimentation gets us Aplain in alphabet 1=
Wcipher.  The key word under Aplain is WHITE. The five complete
cipher alphabets are shown in matrix form in Figure 11-7.

                          Figure 11-7

0 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

4 T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S
5 E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D

Applying these values to the first groups of our message:

A U K H Y  J A M K I  Z Y M W M  J M I G X  N F M L X
E N C O U  N T E R E  D R E D I  N F A N T  R Y E S T

Look at the I.C.'s for these alphabets. The expected is
1.73. The third alphabet is almost exact. Three alphabets seem
low and one is high or are they?  Actually these deviations are
within one sigma of the samples of these sizes 55 tallies, so
the deviations are not abnormal.  The standard deviations may
be calculated with:

For plain text:

           Sigma (O) = Sqrt[ (0.0048)N**3 + (.1101)N**2-
                              (.1149) N]


           Sigma(I.C.)= 26/(N-1)sqrt(N) * sqrt[ (0.0048)N**2 +
                           (.1101)N- (.1149) ]


The more important deviation is from random rather than
observed:

           Sigma(Phi) = 0.2720 sqrt[ N (N-1)]

           Sigma(I.C.)= 7.0711/sqrt[N(N-1)]


   where: sqrt is the square root function
The latter two equations apply to a 26 letter alphabet only.

Since simage is defined as a difference between the observed
and the expected number, divided by the standard deviation, it
may be shown that the I.C. of Alphabet 1 is 1.44-1.00/.13 =
3.38 sigma over random; for this type of distribution which
follows the Chi squared distribution, this amounts to 1 chance
in 300 of being random.

In the foregoing example, standard alphabets were used.
We could easily of used reversed standard alphabets. The U.S.
Army Cipher Disk produces just this type of cipher. It is known
as the Beaufort Cipher.  The direction of the crests and
troughs is reversed when fitting the distributions to the
normal.


SOLUTION BY COMPLETING THE PLAIN-COMPONENT SEQUENCE

When direct standard alphabets are used we can mechanically
solve the cipher by completing the plain component.  The plain
text reappears on only one generatrix and this generatrix is
the same for the whole message.  It is the only generatrix that
yields intelligible text.  This same process can be modified to
work with the alphabets of a Viggy. In this case the correct
generatrix should be distinguishable from the others because it
shows a more favorable assortment of high frequency letters,
and thus can be selected by eye from the whole set of
generatrixes.

Using the previous example, we let the first ten cipher letters
in each alphabet be set down in a horizontal line and the
assumption is made that the alphabets are direct standard with
normal sequences.  See Figure  11-8.

We use the following selection rules:

1. Circle all low frequency letters J, K, Q, X, Z and discard
   any row that has two or more of these letters in it.

2. We weight the eight highest frequency letters (ETANORISH)
   as 1 and the remaining letters as 0. The sum of the weights
   is recorded at the side of each row.


3. Select the highest score.  This works 8 out of 10 times.
   The correct answer is 10 out of 10 if we examine the top
   three scores.   Friedman presents the statistical proof for
   this method in FRE7].

This method works regardless of the key (which might be a
number) as in the Gronsfeld Cipher.

The high frequency generatrixes are selected and their letters
are juxtaposed in columns, the consecutive letters of
intelligible plain text present themselves.  If reversed
standard alphabets are used, we must convert the cipher letters
of each isolated alphabet into their normal, plain component
equivalents, and then proceed as in the case of direct standard
alphabets.


For Alphabet 1, generatrix 5..  E N D N R I D E M N
For Alphabet 2, generatrix 20.. N T R F Y M A R E D

(Read down the columns for plain text.)


Friedman describes a graphical method for generatrix
development in [FR7] and [FR8].

Time to move on to other family members.  We shall identify the
systems and peculiarities of each, but remember that the
solution techniques presented for the papa bear apply equally
well to the children and cousins.


VARIANT CIPHER

The Variant Cipher is just that, a variant of the Vigenere,
except that if the Viggy procedure is followed through, a
peculiar keyword appears, like JYUWFT.  Going back to the
slides, In the Variant, the plaintext appears in the opposite
slide from the one containing the key letter: Vigenere below
the 'A' and Variant above the 'A'.  The application of the high
frequency letters is the same.  The keyword is obtained in a
different fashion.  For the simple encipherment of  COME AT
ONCE with the keyword TENT:

   T E N T     T E N T
   -------     -------
   C O M E     J K Z L
   A T O N     H P B U
   C E - -     J A - -


The setting of the slides for say , the initial T of the
keyword is:

   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
   H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G

The decipherment of a Variant is the same as a Vigenere.

VARIANT SOLUTION BY COMPUTER

>From our trusty CDB, I found Variant.exe and applied it to the
following cryptogram:

 UALOT SILKH RWEBN NRHNL THURD VPVCH DLSUC OABSM YMXFO QAUBR

 RZ.


The solution was found in two steps with a period of 7, keyword
"RABBVTS" which is RABBITS, and reads: Lamp black is
extensively in the manufacture of printing inks, as a pigment
for oil painting and also for waxing and lacquering of leather
as well as in darkening  a furniture polish.  Total time 2 or
3 minutes.


BEAUFORT CIPHER

A third member of the Viggy family, the Beaufort, and while the
same procedure is applied, the slides (or tables)  are
different.  One is a normal alphabet, extending double length
A-Z; the other is reversed, double length Z-A.  So if I = T at
one setting, then T=I at the same setting.  It does not matter
what the index for the key is, the results are the same.

   So:

 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOBQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKL
 TSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBAZYWXVUTSRQPONMLKJI
 *                         *

Again the simple example.

  -------     -------
  C O M E     R Q B P
  A T O N     T L Z G
  C E - -     R A --








BEAUFORT SOLUTION BY COMPUTER NEEDS WORK

I found BEAUFORT.exe at the CDB and applied it two the
following message:

Not so successful this time.  It croaked at period = 6.
The best i could get was "light-" I then reran the program with
a wider key range and found that the true period was 10.  After
some trial and error,
the keyword is LIGHTHOUSE and the message starts:

A fine head land of granite pierced by a natural arch on..
Solution time 15 minutes with at least two wrong trails.

RELATIONSHIPS

LEDGE points out some interesting relationships between the
Vigenere, Variant and Beaufort.  Let A=0, B=1, C=2 .. Z=25,
then:

   O  Vigenere: Cipher Letter = Plaintext letter + keyletter
                (modulo 26)

   O  Variant:  Cipher letter = Plaintext letter - keyletter
                (modulo 26)

   O  Beaufort: Cipher letter = Keyletter - Plaintext letter
                (modulo 26)

Suppose plain text = B and Key = C.  Since B=1 and C=2,
Vigenere ciphertext = 1 + 2 = 3 or D; For Variant ciphertext
1-2=-1 +26 = 25 = Z.

For Vigenere and Variant if key letter = A, since A=0,the
cipher text = plain text.  If we reconstruct a cipher assuming
it is a Vigenere, but it is actually a Variant, we will get the
true plain text but strange keyword.  By subtracting the
Variant equation from the Vigenere equation and setting cipher
text (Viggy) = ciphertext (Variant) and similarly plaintext
(Viggy) = plaintext (Variant), we get the keyletter (Variant)
= - keyletter(Vigenere) the same relationship as that between
ciphertext and plaintext when the keyletter is A in the
Beaufort (since A=0).  Hence, we encipher our strange keyword
with the A Beaufort alphabet to get the Variant key.  The same
holds true if we have a Variant and assume it a Viggy.

If we have a Vigenere and a fragment of the same message
enciphered with the same key in Variant (or visa versa) then,

a. Plaintext = (Ciphertext(Variant)) +
   Ciphertext(Vigenere))/2(modulo 13)

b. Key  = (Ciphertext(Vigenere) - Ciphertext(Variant))/2
   (modulo 13)

If we have a Vigenere and a fragment of a Beaufort for the same
key and plaintext or visa versa then,

c. Plaintext = (Ciphertext(Vigenere)) -
   Ciphertext(Beaufort))/2(modulo 13)

d. Key  = (Ciphertext(Vigenere) +
   Ciphertext(Beaufort))/2(modulo 13)

In equations a-d, two answers are produced because modulo 13
will give one number from 0-12 and another 13-25.  Solution is
by inspection.


PORTA (aka NAPOLEON'S TABLE)

Table 11-7 defines the PORTA Cipher.  In this table the
alphabets are all reciprocal, for example Gplain(Wkey) =
Rcipher, Rplain(Wkey)=Gcipher. They are called complementary
alphabets. Either of two letters may serve as a key letter
indifferently: Gplain(Wkey) or Gplain(Xkey) = Rcipher.

                  Table 11-7

The Porta Cipher permits 13 different ways to disguise a plain
letter.

Again our simple encipherment:

T E N T    T E N T
C O M E    Y M S N
A T O N    W E I E
C E - -    Y T - -

A peculiarity of this system  is that since half the alphabet
is represented by the half of the alphabet, there never will be
found the letters A-M  of the plaintext appearing as A-M in the
ciphertext; no N-Z plaintext appearing as the N-Z ciphertext.
This helpful in placing a tip. THE shows up as a (A-M) (N-Z)
(N-Z) combination.    [BRYA]

Table 11-8 shows a different view of the PORTA Cipher

Now we can divide the M and N distributions, and each half may
be used to fit a normal distribution.  In alphabet 1, the
sequence CDEFGHIJ cipher may easily be recognized as NOPQRSTU
plain; this would fix the keyletters as WX, and therefor the
A...Mplain sequence should begin with Ycipher.  In alphabets
2,3, and 5 the RSTplain sequence may be  spotted at BCDcipher,
ABCcipher, and CDEcipher, respectively, whereas in alphabet 4,
if Ncipher = Eplain, then Ecipher = Nplain; therefore the
original assumptions for the first halves will be confirmed by
the goodness of fit of the distributions for the second halves.
The keys fore these 5 alphabets are derived as (W,X), (G,H)
(I,J), (S,T), and (E,F); from these letters we get WHITE.

In completing the plain component sequence for the Porta
encipherment, the cipher letters are first converted to their
Porta plain-component equivalents and then these letters are
used for the decipherment.  EXCEPT, cipher letters A-M are
completed in a downward direction and cipher letters N-Z are
completed in an upward direction.

Reference [FR7] gives the example:

P K T F F  C D V I T   O B V Z X  C V R E E  G I V J E
T P R K T  O Q C F L   P B V P X  ....

The conversion process and plain component completion of the
first three alphabets are shown below using the generatrix
elimination and weighting scheme developed earlier:

    Alphabet 1         Alphabet 2         Alphabet 3
  P C O C G T O P    K D B V I P Q B    T V V R V R C V
  ---------------    ---------------    ---------------
1 C P B P T G B C    X Q O I V C D O  6 G I I E I E P I
3 D O C O S H C D  3 W P N J U D E N    H J J F J F O J
6 E N D N R I D E    V O Z K T E F Z    I K K G K G N K
  F Z E Z Q J E F  2 U N Y L S F G Y    J L L H L H Z L

  H X G X O L G H  3 S Y W A Q H I W    L A A J A J X A
3 I W H W N M H I    R X V B P I J V    M B B K B K W B
  J V I V Z A I J    Q W U C O J K U  1 A C C L C L V C
  K U J U Y B J K  3 P V T D N K L T  0 B D D M D M U D

  B Q A Q U F A B  1 Y R P H W B C P  0 F H H D H D Q H

The generatrixes with the highest scores are the correct ones.





MODIFIED PORTA

Just as the Vigenere table consisting of direct standard
alphabets has its complementary table of reversed standard
alphabets, a variant of the Porta table can be constructed
where the lower halves  of the sequences run  in opposite
direction to the upper half. For example,


      A,B     A B C D E F G H I J K L M
              Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N

      C,D     A B C D E F G H I J K L M
              N Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O


PROBABLE WORD METHOD OF SOLUTION FOR PORTA

The probable word method is very easy way to attack a Porta
cipher.  Let 1 = any letter in the A-M sequence, and 2 equal
any letter in the N-Z sequence.


P K T F F  C D V I T   O B V Z X  C V R E E  G I V J E
2 1 2 1 1  1 1 2 1 2   2 1 2 2 2  1 2 2 1 1  1 1 2 1 1

T P R K T  O Q C F L   P B V P X  ....
2 2 2 1 2  2 2 1 1 1   2 1 2 2 2

Use the probable word INFANTRY, which has the class notation of
12112222, but in encipherment is reversed to 21221111 pattern.
At position 15,  X C V R E E G I,  we find:

    plain       I N F A N T R Y
    cipher      X C V R E E G I

    key         E W G I S E W G
    derived     F X H J T F X H

Read diagonally, we see WHITE repeated.


COMPUTER SOLUTION OF PORTA

At the trusty CDB is a program called PORTA.exe.  Using it on
the following cipher message found a period of 9 with a
possible key of KL/IJ/CD/MN/AB/OP/OP/EF/QR.  I came up with the
keyword LIDNAOOER

  EYWRR  MOTJJ  QOHFA  LTYQV  SQFPG  EPWTG  RVGUC  DVVBT  EMLMN
  BYSOE  OHFKW  YARQL  PEBSB  ETVXM  WVBCV  XRTIT  JJAMX  EHADX
  VCAXN  MMWZR  WALFY  BTJSP  RTLLP  LZDVD  FZHGE  PBKQR  RUKWQ
  AEAOP  Y

and behold the message cracked to:

    While the Romans used leeks in the culinary depart..

The process took less than two minutes but did not yield the
actual keyword or require it.

GRONSFELD

The GRONSFELD Cipher uses a numerical key and restricts the
Viggy table to just ten alphabets.  We can construct a slide
with one normal alphabet and numbered one like this:

     ... 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...

One half the digits are used for encipherment and the other
half for decipherment.  For example the key is derived as
follows:

       C O N S T I T  U  T  I O N
       1 6 4 8 9 2 10 12 11 3 7 5

The first duplicate letter carries the lower number.

So back to:

    6 2 3 4      6 2 3 4
    C O M E      I Q P I
    A T O N      G V R R
    C E - -      I G - -

Slide method: put the 0 over the C, take the letter to the
right in juxtaposition of the 6 = I, same for A which is G
and so on.  We decipher by looking to the left.

A typical decipherment might look like this for the test word
"YOUR":

        0 2 4 7         0 2 4 7         0 2 4 7         0 2
