                    GERMAN REDUCTION CIPHERS
             ENIGMA IN HISTORICAL AND MODERN TIMES



SUMMARY

In Lecture 9, we circumvent the schedule for another real
treat - the ENIGMA cipher machine.  Considering the focus of
the 1995 ACA convention, several articles in CRYPTOLOGIA, a
recent book by Robert Harris called " Enigma ", a Randomhouse
challenge cipher contest based on the Enigma (won by several of
the KREWE), many questions from my students, I thought we would
address the subject of ENIGMA.

I have had the pleasure to work with ESSAYONS on a project in
which we looked at the security of the original Enigma D
machine in terms of 1995 technology improvements.  ESSAYONS has
brought to light some brilliant insights.

The ENIGMA 95 computer program cited in this lecture is
available at the CDB.  Contact NORTH DECODER for access.

Students have asked 1) what is Enigma and 2) where does Enigma
fit into history of radio communications in WWII?

There are three pillars of radio-intelligence: direction
finding, traffic analysis and deciphering.  Direction finding
equipment and technology is outside the scope of this course.
Traffic analysis has been  discussed in a previous lecture. We
will quickly revisit its value and then follow Professor Jurgen
Rohwer's analysis of the Atlantic Warfare to understand
Enigma's position in cryptographic history.  [ROHE]

The Enigma machine is actually a good starting point for
my discussion on polygraphic and polyalphabetic cipher analysis
(originally planned for Lecture 9).  We start at the endpoint
of a discussion and return to the beginning to build up the
cryptanalytic tools to understand the cleverness of the ENIGMA.
We will continue with the Friedman and MASTERTON in Lecture 10
and following.    [MAST], [FR2], [FR3]





TRAFFIC ANALYSIS REVISITED

Recall that traffic analysis yields information via Crib
messages, Isologs and Chatter.  Crib messages assume a partial
knowledge of the underlying plain text through recognition of
the external characteristics.  Command reports, up and down
German channels, were especially easy for American crypees.  The
origin, serial number range, the cryptonet id, report type, the
file date and time, message length and error messages in the
clear, gave a clear picture of the German command process.
German order of battle, troop dispositions and movements were
deduced by traffic analysis.

An Isolog exists when the underlying plain text is encrypted in
two different systems.  They exist because of relay repetition
requirements, book messages to multiple receivers or error by
the code clerk.  American crypees were particularly effective in
obtaining intelligence from this method.

Traffic analysis boils down to finding the contact relationships
among units, tracking their movements, building up the cryptonet
authorities, capitalizing on lack of randomness in their
structures, and exploiting book and relay cribs.

ENIGMA

ENIGMA was the generic term for the German machine ciphers.  It
was both the name of the first enciphering device and the many
variations used during WWII.  ULTRA was the British code-name
for intelligence derived from cracking the Enigma machine
ciphers by an organization of about 10,000 at Bletchley Park
(BP).   The extent of the penetration of the German command
structure was so profound and so pervasive that it is clear that
BP's work changed not only the conduct but the outcome of Allied
European Operations in WWII.  Most brilliant of ULTRA successes
was against German Afrika Korps whereby the 8th Army HQ read
Enigma telegrams before Rommel himself.  [ASIR]  [KAH2]

There now exists a fair amount of material on Enigma.  The
following annotated outline should give the reader some ideas
how important Enigma was in WWII and sources of information:

ENIGMA CIPHER MACHINE(S)

A: HISTORY

A1: Historical Perspective - Atlantic Theater Warfare in Eight
Phases 1939 - 1945.

Enigma was central to the Battle of the Atlantic in WWII.
Primary sources for the historical perspective come from
Germany, Canada, UK, and USA.  Professor Jurgen Rohwer's
Comparative Analysis of Allied and Axis Radio-Intelligence in
the Battle of the Atlantic, [ROHE]  presents the ENIGMA history
in 8 phases:

     Phase 1 -  Single U-Boats vs Independent Ships
     9/39-6/40  Failure of BP on Schlussel M (Navy Machine)
     Phase 2 -  Wolf Pack vs Convoy
     7/40-5/41  Success of B-Dienst (German Naval decryption
                service)

     Phase 3 -  Evasive Routing, US Entry
     6/41-12/41 U-33 3 rotors recovered, U-110, Munchen
                Bombe limited success 336 settings
                German 4 rotor improvement

     Phase 4 -  BP Successes on Enigma D, US losses
     1/1-6/42

     Phase 5 -  Convoy Battles
     7/47-12/13 Triton Broken ; Rerouting; Milch runs

     Phase 6 -  Bay Offensive
     6/43-8/43

     Phase 7 -  Decreased Operations vs Convoys
     9/43-5/44  Increased use of Ultra

     Phase 8 -  Holding Campaign with Schnorkel U-boats
     6/44-end   New Enigma not released in time for Germany


Professor Rohwer presents 105 primary references.   [ROHE]

A2. Discussion:

>From September, 1939 to June 1940, German U-boats cruised west
of the British Isles and Bay of Biscay to intercept Allied
Merchant ships.  U-boats found enough targets.  Radio signals
were as indispensable to the German Commander in Chief, U-boats
(BdU = Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote - Commander in Chief of
Submarines) for directing his U-boat groups or wolf packs as
they were for Allied commanders  directing the convoys of
merchant ships and their escorts.  The aim of the Axis powers
was to sever the lines of communication by surface radars,
aircraft and especially U-boats to attack ships in the convoys
and thus sink more vessels and tonnage than the Allied
shipbuilding yards could replace.

In the first two phases of the Battle of the Atlantic, there was
a clear superiority with cryptanalytic success on the German
side.  Intelligence was of limited value to actual operations.
The Germans introduced the short signal system, using a codebook
to shorten communications to a few four letter groups which were
superenciphered with daily settings of the Schlussel M [M Key]
in the circuit of Heimische Gewasser (home waters). The Royal
Navy used two crypto-systems - the first was the Naval Cypher
which used 4 figure codebooks and the second was the 5 figure
codebook Naval code.  Both used subtractor tables of 5000 groups
changed monthly.  B-dienst was reading about 30 -50 % of the
Naval Cypher, used by officers.  The Merchant Navy Code was
broken by the B-dienst in March 1940.

In the third phase BP mastered the Schlussel M- 3 and saved
about 400 ships by rerouting convoys.  The Schlussel M-3 used
three rotors out a stock of eight rotors.  BP had limited no
success against VI-VIII and limited success against rotors I-IV.
The boarding of the Krebs gave the British a box of five rotors.
A key to Enigma is its two inner settings, the Walzenlage, or
rotor order, and the Ringstellung, the setting of the alphabet
rings.  In addition to these were the plugboard , the
Steckerverbindungen, of ten pairs of letters and the
Grundstellung, the starting positions of the rotors.  The
capture of U-110 gave BP a consistent set of settings and grid
maps to reference.  The British STR (Submarine Tracking Room)
became key to rerouting ships valued at 1.5 mm GRT.

Phase 4 clearly went to the Germans because of their score
of ships sunk off the Americas.

In Phase 5, near 1942, the BdU had many interceptions because
the B-dienst decrypted the rerouting signals more effectively.
Triton introduced and stumps BP.  In March 1943, BP solves the
Triton and Admiralty changes the operation patterns.

The six and seventh phases German cipher improvements broken by
use of U. S. and British high speed Bombes.

Introduction of Kurier system for high speed transmissions to
new U-boat type XXI was released to late to stop operation
Overlord.

A3: Shipping Losses and Input Tonnage

Allied shipping losses were significant and import tonnage was
reduced because of the U-boat success and communication.

E4: Lauer Analysis of Classical Systems & (Deavours)

Rudolph F. Lauer presents Cipher A Deavours simulation program
p73 ff in reference [LAUE].  Deavour's program reveals the
German Army cipher machine simulated consisted of three rotors
(of eight), rings settings, plugboard (for key super -
encipherment, rotor starting positions and a reflecting rotor.
The program requires the user to set "prepare the machine"  by
setting the rotor wirings, rotor order, rotor starting position,
ringsettings, plugboard pairs and no of plugs used and the
current rotor positions.  It calculates the patchpanel, dis-
placements of cylinder coding and effects of reverse rotors, and
reflecting rotor.  There are no error checks for singularity.


Lauer also presents ten cryptographic systems and representative
cipher machines in increasing order of difficulty.  He presents
72 references (including the Cipher A. Deavours simulations) on
disk.  Each system is not only simulated but the principles for
the entire class of machines are presented.  Ignoring the
programming language, BASIC ( I would choose FORTRAN, others
would choose C, and others APL, and others ADA and..); the
methods applicable to one machine apply equally well to others
in the same class.

I have rearranged his classification methodology and added my
own thoughts to show how ENIGMA fits into the progression of

Clarence Tyner Jr. has spent significant time since 1944 on
German cipher production and reduction efforts.  Starting with a
Model D (circa 1920's) Tyner simulated the original Enigma with
wartime enhancements (plugboard, expanded rotor sets, etc.) and
then improved it while staying within the original concepts of
the original machine (keyboard input, data path through a
plugboard, rotating rotors, reflecting rotors, and output
display.   Presented in detail later in this lecture.

ENIGMA 95

A simulation of an enhanced Enigma Cipher Machine on a standard personal
computer

ABSTRACT :  An exploration into the possibilities of what can be done with the
operating methods of the  Enigma on the personal computer.  The same concept of
employing keyboard input, a plugboard, rotors ( both normal and reflecting ),
Uhr
box and visual output are used, but are expanded by using 100-position rotors
that
intermittently rotate a prime amount after each input, allowing  the number of
rotors  to vary  from 1 to 12, in front or backwards orientation, top permit any
keyboard  character ( including spaces ) to be encrypted, and to simultaneously
display cipher and clear text for editing.  A rotating Character Set converts
single-character input  into 2-digit  numbers for processing and
superencipherment
of numeric output   into alpha bigrams  is possible.  Regular  rotors, Reversing
rotors, Character Sets  and Superencipherment Tables are provided in sets of 100
for extensive variety.      Visual monitor display and paper printout are
employed
and other controls are provided.  It is a "what if" speculation that shows what
could have been possible if the technology had been available.

KEYWORDS : Enigma, prime numbers, rotors, intermittent  rotation,
superencipherment, personal   computer, QBasic, interval method, character set,
random numbers, checksum, plugboard, orientation, internal settings, external
settings.

Everyone is familiar with the Enigma Cipher Machine and the way it operates.

However, the more you learn about it and read about the cryptanalysis that
overcame it in World War II, the more you wonder if it could be improved without
becoming impossibly complicated.  The personal computer provides a means to
improve the concepts that made the original Enigma work, and it can make it work
much better.

This project started as a simulation of the original Enigma.  The pathway of the
electric circuit caused by pressing a key is easy to understand.  It goes from
the
keyboard through the plugboard to the rotors, is reflected from the reversing
rotor, back through the rotors, through the plugboard and finally to a lamp that
lights under a round window with an alphabet on it.  At least one rotor will
rotate during the pressing of the key and the pathway through the rotors will
change from what it was previously.  The internal wiring of the rotors is random
and the cumulative circuit offset combinations produce an extensive number of
substitution alphabets.  The plugboard adds to this, as did the Uhr box.

Aside from administrative and operator errors, the weaknesses of the enigma were
as follows:

   1.  The internal wiring of the rotors was fixed.  It never changed except for
a
few specialized purposes.   While the mathematical possibilities were
astronomical, only a small portion of them were utilized probably because of
manufacturing, cost and logistics considerations.

   2.   There were only eight rotors in a set and only 3 or 4 could be used at a
time.

   3.   The rotors rotated only very restricted basis.  One moved one position
each time.  The second moved only after the first had moved 1 to 26 positions.
The 3rd moved only after the 2nd had moved 1 to 26 positions.  There were
notches
on the rotors to accomplish this and the rotors could be set so that the
movements
occurred at different times, but movement of two rotors was infrequent, and
movement of all rotors was limited and somewhat predictable.

   4.   The reversing ( reflecting ) rotor did not move, nor could it be moved (
except on the earlier models ).

   5.   A subtle weakness was that a given letter could never be encrypted as
itself.

   6.   It was expensive and labor-intensive both to manufacture and to operate.
Once it had been determined how to simulate the rotation of rotors and to
simulate
the transfer of the electrical current between rotors correctly, a major problem
was solved.  Then it was necessary to determine how to keep the internal wiring
connections unchanged during rotation.  This was followed by developing a method
of selecting and installing the rotors at a given position and then how to
rotate
them to an initial setting.   Having an old Model D Enigma ( 3 rotor ) so that
it
was possible to determine what the outcome should be was helpful.

Creation of rotors presented a challenge in establishing the internal wiring and
in making a set from which to choose three.  Edward H. Hebern used the Interval
Method of wiring his rotors, so it was decided to use that approach.  For those
who are not familiar with it, it involves determining the positional difference
(
interval ) between points connected on opposite faces of the rotor.  For a 26 (
A
- Z ) position rotor, the intervals range from 0 to 25, with each interval being
used only once.  But the geometry of the problem prevents one interval from
being
used and requires one interval to be used twice.  All intervals are measured in
the same direction.  For example, a connection from point A on one face to point
C
on the other has an interval of 2 ( assuming opposite positions are identified
with the same letter ).

I don't know how Mr. Hebern did it, but it is a job perfectly suited for a
computer.  At any rate, "wiring" a rotor using the Interval Method can be very
tedious because it involves a lot of trial and error if done manually ( or, as
it
turned out, by computer ).  It would be interesting to know if there is a simple
algorithm.  It is supposed to produce a more secure encryption.  After trying to
do it manually ( by diagramming on paper ), programs were written to do it for
both regular and reversing rotors.  The programs also produce a file on a floppy
disk to simulate a set of rotors and print the results for record purposes.
 Each
rotor had to be unique from all others so use of random numbers was involved.

The plugboard was programmed so that it was possible to enter the 2-point ( from
-
to ) sets that were to be connected.  Multiple sets could be created, just as it
is possible to have multiple cable connections on a mechanical Enigma.
A file of plugboards is not needed because the variance within fixed fields is
derived from the connections, and to allow numbers of connections to be varied.
It was necessary though to provide for editing to insure that each position was
used only once ( as in real life ).

At this point, the idea of expanding the Enigma came into being in the form of
introducing variability between the keyboard and the plugboard such as the Uhr
Box
does.  It was decided to make the Enigma process the data in numerical form and
expand it from a 26 to a 100 character format.  This numerical format ( 00 -99 )
has the disadvantage of doubling the length of a message, but it has certain
advantages.  In addition to handling alphabetic letters, it can also:

   1.  Allow upper/lower cases, numbers, symbols, punctuations, and spaces to be
       encrypted.
   2.  Better conceal the language and individual characters being transmitted.
   3.  Eliminate the problem of a letter not being encrypted as itself.
   4.  Allow a longer period between repetitions.
   5.  Permit superencipherment.
   6.  Provide 100-position rotors and plugboard which are more difficult to
       analyze.
   7.  Facilitate masking control elements in messages. ( e.g., rotor settings,
       etc. )

This format required a method of converting input into 2-digit form.   It was
done
by creating what are called "Character Sets".  These are randomly organized sets
of 100 characters ( upper and lowercase ) that appear on the keyboard.  The
entire
100 positions are not used and the unused are filled with a seldom-used accent
mark.  One hundred sets are available in a file on floppy disk.  The sets are
used
in both encryption and decryption to convert from and back to cleartext.

Using 100 as a common feature, brought into use the digits 00 - 99 to identify
rotors, sets, tables and plugboard positions.  Sets of these components have 100
of each ( "00"  means "100" ).

The next feature was to provide for the unique rotation or non-rotation (
movement
of each rotor is randomly intermittent ) of each regular and the reversing rotor
after each input.  The Character Set also rotates so that doubles ( like "oo" in
book ) are converted differently.  Rotation is by a prime amount to 100 ( 2 and
5
are not used ).  Editing prevents using other numbers.  An additional feature
was
to provide a Rotor Display similar to the windows on the Enigma. This is
primarily
informational but has proven to be helpful in de-bugging the program.....and it
does provide a sense of rotor movement.

Another idea was borrowed from Mr. Hebern.   That was the ability to "insert"
rotors into the machine either forwards or backwards which doubles the number of
rotors in a given set.  It was also possible to provide for a variable number of
rotors.  An arbitrary limit of 12 was chosen but it would be possible to have
more
( though that might be considered overkill ).  The important thing here is that
it
would be possible to employ from 1 to 12 rotors ( from a set of 100 ), depending
on the security desired.  The rotor display automatically adjusts to the
selected
number.

The next feature that was added was the ability to optionally superencipher the
resulting numeric ciphertext.   This involves replacing a 2-digit numeric cipher
with a 2-character alphabetic bigram (e.g., 36 to HK ).  It also permits each
numeric cipher to be represented by one of  6 or 7 bigrams (e.g., 36 could be
HK,
UM, RY, AU, ZM or BI ).  The 7th bigram appears only for selected numerics
because
the 676 ( 26 x 26 ) possible bigrams are evenly distributed amongst the 100
numerics.  In addition, the use of a given bigram in a set for each numeric is
incremented sequentially so using this example, the numeric "36" would be
converted to HK the first time it appears, to UM the second time, etc.  The
first
selection can start at any of the first 6 positions and it cycles around to
position 1 when position 6 or 7 is used.   A SuperEnciphering Table ( Figure 18
)
accomplishes this and there is a matching SuperDeciphering Table ( Figure 19 )
to
reverse it.

Text input requires no use of the  key and the computer buffer handles
rapid input so that the entry of clear or cipher text is faster than that of the
original Enigma.  Input is displayed on the monitor and the resulting
cipher/clear
text is displayed immediately below so that it is possible to visually check it.
If an error occurs, a simple procedure allows you to correct it without having
to
re-type everything.  A screenful of data consists of 6 sets of double lines
( one input, one output ) double spaced with the sets separated by a dotted line
for clarity.  There are 27 inputs per line for a total of  162.  When the 159th
-
161st are entered, a beep sounds to alert you to the approaching end of a
screen.
This allows you to make a final check of the input for errors (and easily
correct
them) before entering the 162nd which triggers printing that screenful to paper.
During the printing you can start entering the next screenful.   A limit of 1943
inputs ( 12 screenfuls less 1 ) was arbitrarily chosen for demonstration
purposes
( more would be possible, depending on memory available ).   This limit can be
easily set to a shorter value to control message length to make cryptanalysis
more
difficult.

Printing is considered essential for the purpose of having a record of what was
sent and how it was encrypted or decrypted ( e.g., was the cleartext entered
correctly and was the machine correctly set ? ).  It also eliminates the need
for
a second person to transcribe the output.  Attached are four exhibits that are
examples of  the printouts that can be produced:

         Exhibit A : Encryption into numeric form
         Exhibit B : Decryption of Exhibit A
         Exhibit C : Encryption in Superenciphered Form
         Exhibit D : Decryption of Exhibit C

      Each exhibit is divided into the following parts:

         1.  The Heading:  This indicates whether it is encryption or
decryption,
and the date and time that the settings were entered .  This does not change for
repeated use of the settings for two or more consecutive messages.  To enter a
new
date/time group or change the internal settings, the program must be completely
restarted.  ( See A1, B1, C1 or D1 )

         2.  The Internal Control Settings:  This indicates the number of
plugboard connections used, the specific plugboard connections, the number of
rotors used, the specific rotor numbers in the position sequence and then each
rotors orientation ( frontwards or backwards ).  The reversing rotor number is
indicated.  Next, the unique rotation value for each rotor and the reversing
rotor
are shown, followed by the character set number and its rotation value.  These
constitute the internal settings that would be specified by the Signal Operating
Instructions ( SOI ).  All of these settings generate an Internal Checksum which
is used to verify that the settings have been correctly entered.

This checksum is printed.  If it does not agree with that provided in the SOI,
then all the settings must be re-entered by restarting the program.
 Intermittent
rotation of each rotor is a function of the installed rotors and previous
entries
and does not have to be specified.


         3.  The External Control Settings:  This lists the settings that the
operator selects and enters for the specific message.  They consist of the
Initial
Settings of each rotor and optionally the Superencipherment Table number if it
is
used.  These settings add to the Internal Checksum and produce an External
Checksum in the form of a 2-digit number ( mod-100 of the total sum ) that is
sent
with the message.  The superencipherment table counter setting is NOT included
and
is NOT sent because the recipient does not have to know it. (See A1, B1, C1, D1
)

        4.  The Input / Output Message Text:  This duplicates that which appears
on the monitor screen and is provided primarily for a message audit ( to insure
that the message was entered correctly ).  Each "line" has 27 inputs with the 27
outputs below.  Twenty-seven was used to provide legibility on an 80-column
screen. Six such "lines" are possible for each screenful.  (See A1, B1, C1 or D1
)

        5.  The Message Control Data:  A count of the input characters ( message
length ) is provided for both superenciphered and non-superenciphered messages.

However, only non-superenciphered ( numeric ciphertext ) messages have the
following additional data provided:

             a.   A Hash Total which is a Mod-100 sum of the numeric cipher
text.
( See A1, B1 )
             b.   A set of Column Check Totals which is the Mod-100 sum of each
of
the 27 columns of cipher text.  This is followed by a non-mod total of the
columns. ( See A2, A3, B2 )
             c.   A total of Row Check Totals which is the Mod-100 sum of each
row
of cipher text.   This is followed by a non-mod total of the rows.  ( See A2,
A3,
B2 )

The purpose of providing column and row totals is to be able to locate
transmission garbles.  They would be sent only if requested.   Variances in any
given column and row would locate the error by intersection.

       6. The Message in Transmission Form:  This is what would be sent and
would
contain only the External Control Settings ( rotor settings, superencipherment
table number and external checksum ) , the date and time group, the message
ciphertext and the character count.  The External Control Settings would be
disguised by a simple manual superencipherment that would be administrative and
outside the operation of the Enigma 95 ( i.e., prescribed by the SOI ).  ( See
A3,
C2 )  If it is decryption, the cleartext message is presented with normal
horizontal spacing and vertically double spaced for convenient reading.  ( See
B3,
D2 )

       7.  Following this is an optional message analysis which is simply a
count
of input and output characters.  This can be skipped and was provided only to
assist any system analysis.  ( See A4 and C3 )

This completes the printing.

Next displayed on the monitor is an option to re-use the Internal Control
Settings
for another message ( it was assumed that these would remain in effect for a
period of time as  was the case for the Enigma ).   If this is not selected, the
program ends.



HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The Enigma 95 is a program written in Microsoft QBasic.  This was done so that
it
could be run on any standard MS DOS computer using MS DOS 5 or higher ( QBasic
is
bundled with MS DOS ) thereby eliminating the need for a specialized computer.
 It
fits onto a 3.5 inch floppy disc, together with the necessary data files that
constitute the Regular Rotors Set, Reversing Rotors Set, Character Sets and
Superencipherment Tables.  It is possible to also have on the same disk, the
programs that create these files and the necessary documentation ( .DOC ) text
files for each one.  This makes the Enigma 95 very portable, very inexpensive
and
very easy to replicate.

Any computer that will run MS DOS QBasic is suitable for the Enigma 95. A color
monitor is preferred but not essential.  A printer is very useful, but could be
eliminated if one is willing to copy output manually from the monitor screen (
as
the original Enigma required ).

There is provided a program that produces a graphic representation of the
circuit
path through the Enigma 95 and a program to produce pseudo-random numbers to use
in programs that produce the rotor disks.  Also included are programs to analyze
the Enigma 95.

---------------------------------------- Figure 10
---------------------------------------


      Below is a listing ( in columns 4 through 16 ) of the 13 Rotor Display
windows of the
      above 36 inputs, to show the intermittent movement of the rotors.   See
Figures 11
      and 12.
      Col. 1 is the Input No.
      Col. 2 is the cleartext input.
      Col. 3 is the Character Set conversion of the cleartext.
      Cols. 4 - 15 are the Regular Rotor displays.
      Col. 16 is the Reversing Rotor display.
      Col. 17 is the numeric cipher output.
      Col. 18 is the superenciphered output.

      When numbers are repeated in a rotor column, this indicates that the rotor
did not
      rotate after that specific input.  When rotation does occur, it rotates
the amount
      previously set for that rotor.  This illustration is not part of the
regular
      operating display.  It was used only as a test and to illustrate
intermittent
      movement.

      11.  When the first screen is filled ( 162 characters input ) or is ended
with a
      backslash ( \ ), the above control settings, etc. are printed, followed by
the text
      screen.  As each subsequent screenful is completed it will be printed.
  This
      continues until the end of the message is reached and the backslash ( \ )
key is
      pressed.  This causes any partial screen to be printed before the message
control
      data, message form and other output is printed.

      If Decipherment ( 2 ) is selected, the process is essentially the same
(entering
      control settings, etc.) except the input is ciphertext and the output is
cleartext.
      Message Control Data is available but message analysis is not.

      ROTORS, SETS AND TABLES

      The term "data files" encompasses the files that constitute the 100 each
groupings of
      Regular Rotors, Reversing Rotors, Character Sets and Superencipherment
Tables that
      are used by Enigma 95.  They have been described earlier and now they are
presented
      for inspection.  They were used in the examples discussed earlier.

      "Posn" is the position value the Character is converted to when it is
input.  The
      characters "rotate" afterwards so that character position values change.
This figure
      shows the set before the first input.

      Letter "A" = 10 initially.  After the first input, "A" = "99", then "88" (
For a
      rotation values of 89 ), etc.

      The left column is the numeric cipher.  The other  7 columns are the
possible super
      encipherments.  36 can be converted to HK , UM , RY , AU , ZM , BI in
turn, depending
      on where the counter starts. A blank causes the counter to be reset to 1.

      The Enigma rotor operation principle has probably been long superseded by
much more
      sophisticated methods of encryption that are faster and more secure, but
it will
      remain interesting for a long time to amateurs such as myself.   It is
something that
      is understandable and before the advent of the computer, resulted in some
beautiful
      machines.

      The Enigma 95 is not one now, but  I believe that it could be "translated"
into a
      handsome electro-mechanical device.  It is something to dream about.

      The only absolutely secure cipher is the One Time Pad and it has the
disadvantage of
      requiring copies to be destroyed after one use.  The Enigma 95 is an
attempt to
      approach this holy Grail of cryptography by providing an almost unlimited
supply of
      enhanced (both in size and method of rotation) Rotors, Character Sets,
      Superencipherment Tables and a lengthened Plugboard.  While I cannot prove
it
      mathematically or otherwise, I suspect that the ability to use almost
unlimited
      expendable sets of all possible combinations of these for very limited
periods (throw
      away feature) such as is possible in the Enigma 95, would strengthen any
cipher
      considerably by preventing the accumulation of sufficient material on
which to base
      an in-depth cryptanalysis.  Any comments would appreciated.
