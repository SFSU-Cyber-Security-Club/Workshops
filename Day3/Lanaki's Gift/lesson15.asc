                     STATISTICAL ATTACKS



SUMMARY

Lecture 15 considers the role and influence that statistics
and probability theory exert on the cryptanalysis of unknown
ciphers.  We develop our subject by the following references:
[FRE3], [SINK], [MAST], [ELCY], [GLEA], [KULL].

DISCUSSION

As you may know, William F. Friedman and Dr. Solomon Kullback
were the first Americans to apply Probability Theory and
Applied Statistics to the Science of Cryptanalysis. Their
achievements were so dynamic that American Crypee's  were
able to read the secret messages of many of the Foreign
Governments that it dealt with. [YARD]

SCOPE

We shall look at three tests: Kappa test for coincidences,
Chi test or cross product test for superimposition, and Phi
test for monoalphabeticity.  We will briefly touch on
Gleason's logarithmic weighting scheme for determination of
number of letters to differentiate a transposition.  The
References and Resource section is substantially broadened
with nearly 150 more choice plums.


BASIC THEORY OF COINCIDENCES

We have already looked at a table of Phi Values For
Monoalphabetic and Digraphic Text By Kullback in Lecture 1.
We have also studied various Phi values for Xenocrypts
in Lecture 5. We found that the probability is related to
coincidences and that it is of significance when we
investigate repetitions of letters in a cipher.

We know that the probability of monographic coincidence (1)
of random text employing a 26 letter alphabet is 0.0385 , (2)
in English telegraphic plain text is 0.0667.  We have defined
these values as Kr and Kp respectively.


One of the most important techniques in cryptanalysis is that
of applying the Kappa Test or Test of Coincidences.  The most
important purpose for this test is to ascertain whether two
or more sequences are correctly superimposed.  Correct means
the sequences are so arranged to facilitate or make possible
a solution.  The Kappa test has the following theoretical
basis the following circumstances:

(1) If any two rather lengthy sequences of characters are
    superimposed, it will be found that as successive pairs
    of letters are brought into vertical juxtaposition, that
    in a certain number of cases the two superimposed letters
    will coincide,

(2) If we are dealing with random text (26 alphabet) there
    will be 38 or 39 cases of coincidence per 1000 pairs of
    letters examined because Kr = 0.0385.

(3) If we are dealing with plain text (English) there will be
    66 or 67 cases of coincidence per 1000 pairs of letters
    examined because Kp = 0.0667.

(4) If the superimposed sequences are wholly monoalphabetic
    encipherments of plain text by the same cipher alphabet,
    there will be 66 or 67 cases of coincidence per 1000
    pairs of letters examined because in monoalphabetic
    substitution there is a fixed or unvarying relation
    between plain text and cipher text, so that for
    statistical purposes the cipher text behaves just as if
    it were normal plain text.

(5) Even if the two superimposed sequences are polyalphabetic
    in character, there still will be 66 or 67 cases of
    coincidence or identity per 1000 pairs of letters
    examined provided the two sequences really belong to the
    same cryptographic system and are superimposed at the
    proper point with respect to the keying sequence.

(6) This last point may be seen in the two polyalphabetic
    messages below:  They have been enciphered poly-
    alphabetically by the same two primary components sliding
    against each other.  The two messages begin at the same
    point in the keying sequence.  Consequently, they are
    identically enciphered, letter for letter, the only
    differences between them is due to differences in plain
    text.

 Cipher  P  Q  N  T U F B  W  D  J  L Q H Y Z  P  T M Q I


Note, that (a) in every case in which two superimposed cipher
letters are the same, the plain text letters are identical
and (b)  in every case in which two superimposed cipher
letters are the different, the plain text letters are
different.  In such a system, even though the cipher alphabet
changes from letter to letter, the number cases of identity
or coincidence in the two members of a pair of superimposed
cipher letters will still be about 66 or 67 per thousand
cases examined, because the two members of each pair of
superimposed letters are in the same alphabet and it has been
seen in (4) that in monoalphabetic cipher text K is the same
as for plain text, viz, 0.667.  The fact that in this case
each monoalphabet contains just two letters does not affect
the theoretical value of K (Kappa) and whether the actual
number of coincidences agrees closely with the expected
number based upon Kp = 0.0667 depends upon the lengths of the
two superimposed sequences.  Messages No's 1 and 2 are said
to be superimposed correctly , that is brought into proper
juxtaposition with respect to the keying sequences.

(7) Now change the situation by changing the juxtaposition to
    an incorrect superimposition with respect to the keying
    sequence.

It is evident that the two members of every pair are not in
the same cipher alphabets and any identical letters after
superimposition is strictly accidental. Actually the number
of repetitions will approximate Kr = 0.0385.

Note again, that in every case in which two superimposed
cipher letters are the same, the plain text letters are
not identical and in every case in which two superimposed
cipher letters are the different, the plain text letters are
no always different.  Look at the superimposed T(cipher)'s
representing two different plain text letters and that the S
in "COURSE" gives the value J (cipher) and in the word
ABSOLUTELY gives H (cipher).   It should be clear that an
incorrect superimposition by two different plain-text letters
enciphered by two different alphabets may "by chance" produce
identical cipher letters, which on superimposition yield
coincidence but have no external indications as to
dissimilarity in plain text equivalents.  This incorrect
superimposition will coincide by a value of Kr = 0.0385.

(8) Note the two Z's and they represent the plain text L.
    This occurred because the same cipher alphabet came into
    play by chance twice to encipher the same plain text
    letter both times.  This may distort the Kr value for
    some systems.

(9) In general, in the case of correct superimposition the
    probability of identity or coincidence is Kp = 0.0667; in
    the case of incorrect superimposition, the probability is
    greater than or equal to Kr = 0.0385.  The Kappa test,
    aka coincidence test is defined by these values.


APPLYING THE KAPPA TEST

When we say Kp = 0.0667, this means that in a 1000 cases
where two letters are drawn at random from a large volume of
plain text, we should expect 66 or 67 cases of two letters to
coincide or be identical.  Nothing is specified what these
letters shall be; they can be two Z's or two E's.  Another
way is to consider that at random 6.67% of the comparisons
made will yield coincidences. So for 2000 examinations, we
expect 2000 x 6.67% = 133.4 coincidences [ use integers and
round down to 133].  Or 20,000 comparisons means 1,334
coincidences.

A more practical approach is to find the ratio of observed
number of coincidences to the total number of cases in
question that may occur, i.e. the total number of comparisons
of superimposed letters.  When the ratio is closer to 0.0667
than 0.0385 the correct superimposition has been found.  This
is true because both members of each pair of superimposed
letters belong to the same monoalphabet and therefore the
probability of their coinciding is 0.067; whereas, in the
case of incorrect superimposition, each pair belongs to
different monoalphabets and the probability of their
coinciding approaches 0.0385 rather than 0.0667.

To use the Kappa test requires calculating the total number
of comparisons in a given case and the actual number of
coincidences in the case under consideration. When two
messages are superimposed, the total number of comparisons
made equals the number of superimposed letters. When more
than two messages are superimposed in a superimposition
diagram (Lecture 13) it is necessary to calculate the number
of comparisons based on the number of letters in the column.


          n letters  =  n(n-1)/2  pairs or comparisons,
            in column

For a column of 3 letters , there are 3(2)/2 = 3 comparisons.
We compare the 1st with the 2nd, 2nd with 3rd and 1st with
3rd columns.  The more general probability formula is

             nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!

where we determine the number of combinations of n different
things taken r at a time.  For two letters, r is always 2,
so n!/r!(n-r)! is the same as


           n(n-1)(n-2)!/2(n-2)!

           becomes   n(n-1)/2

with the cancellation of terms using (n-2)!.

RULE

The number of comparisons per column times the number of
columns in the superimposition diagram of letters gives the
total number of comparisons.  The extension to this reasoning
is where the superimposition diagram involves columns of
various lengths, then we add together  the number of
comparisons for columns of different lengths to obtain a
grand total.  Table 15-1 shows the number of letters in a
column versus the number of comparisons calculated.  [FRE3]

       15            105           29            406
                                   30            435

In ascertaining the number of coincidences in the case of a
column containing several letters, we still use the n(n-1)/2
formula, only in this case,  n is the number of identical
letters in the column. The reasoning is essentially the same
as above.  The total number of coincidences is the sum of the
number of coincidences for each case of identity.

Given the column:


                C
                K
                B
                K
                Z
                K
                C
                B
                B
                K

There are 10 letters with 3B's, 2C's 4K's and 1 Z. The 3B's
yield 3 coincidences, the 2 C's yield 1 coincidence, the 4
K's yield 6 coincidences. The sum is 3 + 1 + 6 = 10
coincidences in 45 comparisons = 0.2222

ENCIPHERMENT WITH SAME KEY BUT DIFFERENT INITIATION POINTS

In Lecture 13, I ended with the note that several messages
enciphered by the same keying sequence but each beginning at
a different point presented a challenge.  The best attack is
that by superimposition and the Kappa test is used to
correctly line up the messages with respect to each other.

It is understood that the messages may be shifted relative to
each other at many points of superimposition but their is
only one point of superimposition for each message which
corresponds to monoalphabetic columnar superimposition of the
cipher text.


The method:

(1) Number the message according to their lengths.

(2) Fix message 1, message 2 is placed under it so that the
    first pair of letters coincide.

(3) Examine, calculate total number of cases in which
    superimposed letters are identical, thus the observed
    number of coincidences. The total number of superimposed
    pairs is calculated and multiplied by 0.0667 to find the
    expected number of coincidences.

(4) If the observed number is considerably below the expected
    number, or if the ratio of the observed number of
    coincidences to the total is closer to 0.0385 than
    0.0667, then the superimposition is wrong and we shift
    message 2 one letter to the left.

(5) Repeat steps (3) - (4) until the correct superimposition
    is found.



(6) Test message 3 against message 1 and then against message
    2.

(7) Continue the process until all the messages are lined up
    correctly.

Computers are a big help in this process.


EXAMINE OF KAPPA TEST

Given 4 messages of 30 intercepted using a long enciphered

The number of comparisons is 101 x 0.0667 = 7 coincidences
which is less than the observed 8.  Nice start but
suspicious.  Shifting one letter to right the number of
coincidences is 4. One more shift = 3.  Then:

Now 98 x 0.0667 = 6.5366   versus 9 coincidences or 30% more
than the first comparison.  The first test was accidental.
The jump is normal from incorrect to correct.  The correct
superimposition is either 100% correct or incorrect.

Friedman suggests that tests be made first to the right and
then to the left, one letter at a time for best efficiency.
[FRE3]

It is possible to systematize our investigation by testing
three or four messages at a time.

We make a diagram where the number of coincidences are
tallied with all three messages:


                 1     2     3
              -----------------
            1|   x     9     3
             |
            2|   x     x     3
             |
            3|   x     x     x


The number of tallies in cell 1-2 is 9 as examined.  A column
which shows identical letters in messages 1 and 3 yields a
tally in 1-3, between 2 and 3 goes to 2-3 and so forth.  Only
when a superimposition yields three identical letters in a
column is a tally to be recorded in 1-3 or 1-2 (3
coincidences.

So adding message 3 to the investigation:

              3|   x     x     x


Successive number of columns are examined and coincidences
(of messages 1 and 3 and 2 and 3) are tabulated.  We find:



Combination  Total Number  Number of Coincidences
              of                                  Delta
             Comparisons   Expected  Observed       %


  1 - 3        99           ~ 7        3           -57
  2 - 3        96           ~ 6        3           -50
 1- 2- 3      293           ~ 20      15           -21


A correct superimposition for one of the three combinations
may yield such good results as to mask  the bad results for
the other two combinations.

We shift message 3 one space to the right with the following
results:

SUBSEQUENT SOLUTION STEPS

These four messages were enciphered by a long keying
sequence. We now have found the correct superimposition of
the four messages. Therefore, the text has been reduced to
monoalphabetic columnar form and can be solved.  What was not
given on this example was that the enciphering device was a
U. S. Army Cipher Disk and that the key was intelligent as
well as the alphabets are reversed standard.

It doesn't matter to the Kappa test what kind of cipher
alphabets were used or whether or not the key is random or
intelligent.  We try our favorite technique - the probable
word on message 1 of DIVISION.


Ciphertext      P G L P N H U F R K S A U Q Q
Assumed Plain   D I V I S I O N
Resultant Key   S O G X F

nope, shift one letter right.

Ciphertext      P G L P N H U F R K S A U Q Q
Assumed Plain   . D I V I S I O N
Resultant Key   . J T K

nope, shift one more, and one and finally to the end with no
resultant intelligent key.

Ciphertext      P G L P N H U F R K S A U Q Q
Assumed Plain           R E G I M E N T N O
Resultant Key           E L A N D O F T H E

which suggests LAND of T(HE) which yields REGIMENT NO. More
assumptions yield an E before LAND and the cipher text
yielding IS for the plain.  The process continues one letter
at a time and checking the cipher versus the plain for
reconstructive clues.

We can use all four messages to gives us clues by multiple
superimposition.



     Key                     E L A N D O F T
No 1 Ciphertext      P G L P N H U F R K S A U Q Q
     Plain                   R E G I M E N T

No 2 Ciphertext            C W H P K K X F L U M K
     Plain                   I E L D T R A I

No 3 Ciphertext        W F W T D N H T G M R A A Z
     Plain                   L I N G K I T C

No 4 Ciphertext          T U L D H N Q E Z Z U T Y
     Plain                   T I T A N K G U


We see  No. 2 gives us FIELD TRAIN, No 3 has ROLLING KITCHEN,
and No 4 with ANTITANK GUN.  These words yield additional
letters.  If the key is unintelligent text we use the
messages against each rather than against the key.

UNKNOWN SEQUENCES

The previous example assumed a known cipher alphabet.  When
it is not known, Data for solution by indirect symmetry by
detection of isomorphs cannot be expected, for isomorphs may
not be produced by the system. Solution can be reached only
if there is sufficient text to permit analysis of columns for
superimposition diagram. Large amount of text yields
repetitions and the basis for probable word assumption.
After establishment of a few values for cipher text letters
does indirect symmetry come into play.  Each column requires
15 -20 letters minimum. These can be studied statistically
and if two columns have similar characteristics, they may be
combined using the cross product test.




RUNNING KEY PRINCIPLE

The running - key principle may be interesting in principle
but difficult in practice. Mistakes in encipherment or
transmission, essentially decrease the likely hood of the
correct decipherment. The running Key does improve
cryptographic security but the mechanical details involved in
the production, reproduction, and distribution of such keys
represents a formidable challenge - enough to destroy the
effectiveness of the system for practical purposes
(voluminous communication).

Suppose a basic unintelligible, random sequence of keying
characters which is not derived from the interaction of two
or more shorter keys and which NEVER repeats is employed only
ONCE as a key for encipherment.  Can such a cryptogram be
solved. No. No method of attack will solve this because the
system is not uniquely solvable.

Two things are required for solution: the logical answer must
be offered and it must be unique. The Bacon-Shakespeare
"cryptographers tend to overlook the latter issue.
To attempt to solve a cryptogram enciphered as previously
described is like solving an equation in two unknowns with
absolutely no data available for solution but the solution
itself.  The key is one unknown and the plain text is the
other.  Any one quantity may be chosen and yield a viable
result without the required uniqueness constraint being
observed.  There are an infinite number of solutions
possible.

The problem is better defined when the running key
constitutes intelligent test, or if it is used to encipher
more than one message, or if it is the secondary result of
the interaction of two or more short primary keys which go
thru cycles themselves.   The additional information in these
cases are enough to meet the uniqueness constraint.

CROSS-PRODUCT TEST OR CHI [X]

The KAPPA test is used to prepare data for analysis. It
circumvents the polyalphabetic obstacle. It moves the
solution from polyalphabetic to monoalphabetic terms. The
solution can be reached if their is some cryptographic
relationship between the columns, or the letters can be
combined into a single frequency distribution.

The amount of data has to be sufficient for comparison
purposes and this depends on the type of cipher alphabets
involved.  Although the superimposition diagram may be
composed of many columns, often only a relatively small
number of different cipher alphabets are put into play.
The number of times that a secondary alphabet is employed is
directly related to the key text or number of keying elements
in the sequence.



In the running-key cipher using a long phrase or book as a
key, the key is intelligible text and it follows that the
secondary alphabets will be employed with frequencies
directly  related to the respective frequencies of occurrence
of letters of plain text. The key letter 'E' alphabet should
be most frequent, 'T' next and so forth. J, K, Q, X, Z are
improbable, so the cryptanalyst usually handles no more than
19-20 secondary alphabets.

It is possible to study the various distributions for the
columns of the superimposition diagram with the view of
assembling those distributions which belong to the same
cipher alphabet, say 'E', thus making the determination of
values easier in a combined distribution.

If the key is random text, and assuming sufficient text
within the columns, the columnar frequency distributions may
afford the opportunity to amalgamate a large number of small
distributions into a smaller number of larger distributions.
This is known as matching and we use the Cross-Product or Chi
Test, aka X test.

The Chi test is used to identify distributions which belong
to the same cipher alphabet.  It is used when the amount of
data is not very large.

DERIVATION OF CHI TEST [KULL]

The theory of monographic coincidence in plain text was
originally developed by Friedman and applied in his technical
paper written in 1925 dealing with his solution of messages
enciphered by a cryptographic machine known as the "Herbern
Electric Super-Code." The paper is among the Riverbank
Publications in 1934.

The probability of coincidence of two A's in plain text is
the square of the probability of occurrence of the single
letter A in such text.  Samething with B's through Z's.
The sum  of these squares for all letters of the alphabet as
shown in Table 15-2, is found to be 0.0667.  This is almost
double the combined probability of random text for hitting
two random text letters coincidentally or:

   26 letters x 1/26 x 1/26 = 1/26 = 0.0385 = Kr

  Total         1,000.00        1.0000           0.0667

We have seen this value before as Kp.  It is the probability
that any two letters selected at random in a large volume of
normal English plain text will coincide.

Given a 50 letter plain-text distribution:

3   1 1 7 1   2 3     1 2 5 6     2 5 6 2   2
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z


The number of pairings that can be made are n (n-1)/2 =

(50 x 49)/2 = 1,225 comparisons.  According to the theory of
coincidences, there should be 1,225 x 0.0667 = 81.7065 or
approximately 82 coincidences of single letters.  We look at
the distribution and finds there are 83 for a very close
agreement.  [N(N-1)/2]


3   1 1 7 1   2 3      1 2 5  6      2 5  6  2   2
A B C D E  F G H I J K L M N  O  P Q R S  T  U V W X Y Z
3+0+0+1+21+0+0+1+3+0+0+0+1+10+15+0+0+1+10+15+1+0+1+0+0+0=83

If N is the total number of letters in the distribution, then
the number of comparisons is N(N-1)/2 and the expected number
of coincidences may be written:

                       .0067N(N-1)/2

             or       (.0067N**2 - 0.0667N)/2      eq. I


If we let Fa = number of occurrences of A in the foregoing
distribution, the number of coincidences for letter A is
Fa(Fa-1)/2. Similarly for B, we have Fb(Fb-1)/2. The total
number of coincidences for the distribution is:

     Fa(Fa-1)/2 +Fb(Fb-1)/2+...+Fz(Fz-1)/2.

Let Fa = any letter A..Z and d = the sum of all terms that
follow it. The distribution d(Fa**2-Fa)/2 represents the
actual coincidences.

Although derived from different sources we equate the terms.

          d(Fa**2-Fa)/2 = (.0067N**2 - 0.0667N)/2

           and dFa = N

          d(Fa**2-Fa) = (.0067N**2 - 0.0667N)

          dFa**2 - N  = (.0067N**2 - 0.0667N)

          dFa**2  = .0067N**2 + 0.9333N         eg. II

Equation II tells us the sum of the squares of the absolute
frequencies of a distribution is equal to 0.0667 times the
square of the total number of letters in the distribution,
plus 0.933 times the total number of letters in the
distribution.  We let S2 replace dFa**2.

Suppose two monoalphabetic distributions pertain to the same
cipher alphabet. If they are to be correctly combined into a
single distribution, the latter must still be monoalphabetic.
We use subscripts 1 and 2 to indicate the distributions in
question.   So:


 d(Fa1+Fa2)**2 = .0067(N1+N2)**2 + 0.9333(N1+N2)

expanding terms:



dFa1**2 +2dFa1Fa2 +dFa2**2 =0.0667(N1**2 +2N1N2 + N2**2) +
                            .9333N1 +.9333N2      eq. III




                dFa1**2  = .0067N1**2 + 0.9333N1

                dFa2**2  = .0067N2**2 + 0.9333N2

and rearranging:

 .0667N1**2 +.9333N1 +2dFa1Fa2 + .0667 N2**2 + .9333N2 =

     .0667(N1**2 +2N1N2 +N2**2) + .9333N1 +.9333N2

further reducing:

       2dFa1Fa2 = 0.667 (2N1N2)


finally:

       dFa1Fa2 = 0.667                      eq. IV
       -------
       N1N2

This equation permits the establishment of an expectant value
for the sum of products of the corresponding frequencies of
the two distributions being considered for amalgamation. The
Chi test or Cross-product test is based on Equation IV.

Given two distributions to be matched:

     1 4   3   1     1     1     1     3 2 2 1   1 3   2
F1 - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

       2       3     1   1     1 1     3 1 1         1 2
F2 - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z


We juxtapose the frequencies for convenience.

                                            N1 = 26
Fa1    1 4   3   1     1     1     1     3 2 2 1   1 3   2
       A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Fa2      2       3     1   1     1 1     3 1 1         1 2
                                            N2 = 17
Fa1Fa2 0 8 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 9 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 4
             d=30

          N1N2 = 26 x 17 = 442

          dFa1Fa2    30
          -------  = --   = 0.0711
           N1N2      442

or 442 x 0.0667 = 28.15 expected value versus 30. The two
distributions very probably belong together.

To point out the effectiveness of the correct Chi test
placement, we look at the example but juxtaposed one interval
to the left.

                                                 N1=26
     1 4   3   1     1     1     1     3 2 2 1   1 3   2
F1 - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
F2 - B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A
     2       3     1   1     1 1     3 1 1         1 2
                                                 N2=17
Fa1Fa2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
          dFa1Fa2=2+3+2+3= 10


          dFa1Fa2     10
          --------  = ---- =  0.226
           N1N2       442


Thus, if the two distribution pertain to the same primary
components then they are not properly superimposed.  The Chi
test may be applied also to cases where two or more frequency
distributions must be shifted relatively in order to find the
correct superimposition.  The problem determines whether we
use direct superimposition or shifted superimposition of the
second distribution in question.


APPLYING THE CHI TEST TO PROGRESSIVE-ALPHABET SYSTEM


We assume for this example that the secondary alphabets were
derived from the interaction of two identical mixed primary
components. The cipher alphabet is based on HYDRAYLIC...Z
sequence shifted one letter to the right for each encipher-
ment.  Based on Figure 15-1, the horizontal sequences are all
identical and shifted relatively. The letters inside the
square are plain-text letters.

Instead of letters in the cells of the square we tally the
normal frequencies of the letters occupying the respective
cells.  For the first 3 rows we have:


  1 . . . 5 . . . . 10 . . . . 15 . . . . 20 . . . . . 26

A 7 3 4 8 3 1 12 3 2     3 8 7  3   6 9 1 1      3 2 4  8
B 112 3 2     3 8 7  3   6 9 1 1      3 2 4  8 7 3 8 3  1
C 3 112 3 2     3 8 7  3   6 9  1 1     3 2 4  8 7 3 4  8

The shift required in this case is 5 to the right to match up
A and B.  Note that amount of displacement, or number of
intervals, the B sequence must be shifted to make it match A
sequence corresponds exactly to the distance between the
letters A and B in the primary cipher component.

                  ..... A U L I C B ......
                        0 1 2 3 4 5




The fact that the primary plain component is identical with
the primary cipher component is coincidental.  The
displacement interval is being measured on the cipher
component.

The Given Cipher message is written into a 26 column (26
alphabets) square rather than the standard 5 letter groups.

A frequency distribution square is compiled, each column of
the text forming a separate distribution in columnar form in
the square.  See Figure 15-2.  Note the size of each
distribution on the right side of the square under N.


The Chi test is applied to the horizontal rows in the square.
Since the test is statistical, it is more reliable as the
size of the distribution increases. We choose the V and W
distributions because they have the greatest total number of
tallies at 53 and 52 occurrences, respectively.

More tests would indicate that we have found the best
correlation for these two cipher alphabets. Therefore, the
primary cipher component has the letters V and W in these
positions.  The 4th cell of the W distribution must be placed
under the 1 st cell of the V distribution per Test 3.

              . . . V . . W . . .

The next best row is F with 51 occurrences.  We must test
this row against V, W, and V+W.  Test 4,5 and 6 show the
correct superimpositions for the F row.  Note that  the
computer can be a big time help in this evaluation.

This test yield the sequence:

     V . . W . . . F .


As the work progresses, we use smaller and smaller
distributions. This decrease in information is
counterbalanced by the number of superimpositions being
reduced as the primary cipher alphabet comes to the surface.


The completely reconstructed primary cipher component (both
plain and cipher were specified as identical) is:


1 . . . 5 . . . .10 . . . .15 . . . .20 . . . . . 26
V A L W N O X F B P Y R C Q Z I G S E H T D J U M K


In practice, the matching process would be interrupted after
a few letters of the primary component were retrieved and the
skeleton of a few words became apparent.

We ascertain the initial position for the primary cipher
component and decipher the cryptogram.

...... and so forth.


The interesting point is that all the tallies in the
frequency square were made of cipher letters occuring in the
cryptogram, and the tallies represented their actual
occurences.  We compared cipher alphabet to cipher alphabet.
The plain text letters were held as unknown through out the
process.


CRACKING THE PROGRESSIVE CIPHER USING INDIRECT SYMMETRY

What happens when we do not have enough data to foster the
statistical attack?  We can use indirect symmetry because of
certain phenomena arising from the mechanics of the
progressive cipher encipherment method itself.

Take:

Plain    HYDRAULICBEFGJKMNOPQSTVWXZ
Cipher   FBPYRCQZIGSEHTDJUMKVALWNOX


Encipher FIRST BATTALION by the progressive method sliding
the cipher component to the left one interval after each
encipherment.:

         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314
Plain    F I R S T B A T T A L I O N
Cipher   E I C N X D S P Y T U K Y Y
Index    F E B C I L U A R D Y H Z X
shift(-)   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213


Repeated letters in the text are two I's, three T's and two
A's. Lets look at them:


         F I R S T B A T T A L I O N
         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314
Plain    . I . . . . . . . . . I . .
Cipher   . I . . . . . . . . . K . .
Plain    . . . . T . . T T . . . . .
Cipher   . . . . X . . P Y . . . . .
Plain    . . . . . . A . . A . . . .
Cipher   . . . . . . S . . T . . . .


The two I's are 10 letters apart in both the plain and cipher
components.  Since the cipher component is displaced one step
after each encipherment, two identical letters n intervals
apart in the plain text must yield cipher equivalents which
are n intervals apart in the cipher component.  This leads to
the probable word and indirect symmetry attack on the
progressive cipher.

A second flaw concerns the repeated cipher letters. Look at
the three Y's.

         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314
Plain    . . . . . . . . T . . . O N
Cipher   . . . . . . . . Y . . . Y Y

Reference to the plain component shows that the N O . . . T
is reversed in order with respect to the plain text.  The
intervals are correct.  Since the cipher component is shifted
one to the left each encipherment, two identical letters n
intervals apart in the cipher text must yield plain text
equivalents which are n intervals apart in the cipher
component.   If the cipher is displaced to the left than the
order of the plain is logically reversed.

Given the following message, which is assumed to start with
the military greeting COMMANDING GENERAL FIRST ARMY (probable
words) the data yielded by this assumption is:

IKMKI  LIDOL  WLPNM  VWPXW  DUFFT
FNIIG  XGAMX  CADUV  AZVIS  YNUNL ...

26                                                F


Applying indirect symmetry to the above square gives:

       1 . . . 5 . . . .10 . . . .15 . . . .20 . . . . . 26
Plain  A     L I C   E F G   M N O     S             Y D R
Cipher     M K V . L W N O . F . P . . . . . I . . . . T
       D . . . . . . . . . . M

Setting C (plain) = I (cipher) for the first encipherment,
the 8th value, I (plain) = D (cipher)  which yields D and
eventually X.  We use the partial sequences to unlock other
letters.  Using the word ARMY we open the gaps some more.


           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
Plain      N I I G X G A M X  C  A  D
Cipher     . I L . . . . E O  .  .  R

 The next word after ARMY might be WILL.  We then insert the
W in the plain and G in the Cipher.

The presence of MMM, WWW, FFF in the cipher might be a short
word used several time.. hmm how about THE?? replacing any
one of the triplets with THE, applying indirect symmetry, we
may have a wedge.

MACHINE CRYPTOGRAPHY

The principles discussed in the previous paragraph may be
used with progressive systems in which the interval is > 1
and with modifications to those intervals which are irregular
but follow a pattern such as 1-2-3, 1-2-3, ... or 2-5-7-3-1,
2-5-7-3-1- and so on. The latter type of progression is
encountered in certain mechanical cryptographs.  [FRE3]

THE PHI TEST h FOR MONOALPHABETICITY

The Chi test is based on the general theory of coincidences
and the probability constants Kp and Kr. Now two
monoalphabetic distributions when correctly combined will
yield a single distribution which still will be
monoalphabetic in character.  The Phi (h) test is used to
confirm that a distribution is in fact alphabetic.

DERIVATION Of PHI h TEST

Start with a uniliteral frequency distribution, the total
number of pairs of letters for comparison purposes is:

              N(N-1)/2    for N letters

from the discussion on the Chi (a) test we found that the
expected value of Fa(Fa-1)/2 +..+Fz(Fz-1) for A...Z is equal
to the theoretical number of coincidences of two letters to
be expected in N(N-1)/2  for N letters, which for normal
English plaintext is  Kp x N(N-1)/2 and for random text is Kr
x N(N-1)/2.

      d Fi (Fi-1)    = E(hp)  = Kp x N(N-1)

      for i= A to Z            for plain text


      d Fi (Fi-1)    = E(hr)  = Kr x N(N-1)

      for i= A to Z            for random text


E(a) means the average or expected value of the expression in
parenthesis, Kp = 0.0667 for normal English plain text, Kr =
0.0385 for random English text (26 letters).







Example 1:

Is the following enciphered monoalphabetically:


1     1 2 3 4 2     1       4 2   1           1   3  N=25
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

E(ao) = 1x0+1x0+2x1+3x2+4x3+2x1+1x0+4x3+2x1+1x0+1x0+3x2=
        2+6+12+2+12+2+6 = 42     o = observed

E(ap) = Kp x N(N-1) = 0.0667 x 25 x 24 = 40    plain

E(ar) = Kr x N(N-1) = 0.0385 x 25 x 24 = 23.1  random

Since the E(ao) =42 is closer to E(ap) = 40, the distribution
is most likely monoalphabetic.

Example 2:

Y O U I J   Z M M Z Z  M R N Q C   X I Y T W   R G K L H

The distribution is

    1       1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 0 2 1 2   1 1   1 1 2 3 N=25
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

d Fi(Fi-1) = 18

Since E(ar) is closer to E(ao) the enciphement is probabably
polyalphabetic to suppress the frequency distribution. The
message was enciphered actually by 25 alphabets used in
sequence.


LOGARITHMIC WEIGHT: CHI SQUARED TEST

Gleason discusses an important application of the theory of
testing hypothesis. Given a number of messages, some of which
are transposed English text and some are flat text. We want
to develop a test for picking out the transpositions, and to
accomplish this is possible to frame a statistical hypothesis
concerning each message.  Gleason discusses a 5 step
procedure to 1) obtain probability information, 2) calculate
its critical region, 3) differentiate by weighted logs 4)
calculate the values of alpha and beta statistical inference
5) examine the normal distribution for given values of alpha
and beta.  The answer tells us how many letters to examine at
some level of certainty to determine if we are dealing with a
transposition.  Chapter 13 Problem 1 gives a reasonable look
at the process. [GLEA]  Problems 2 and 3 look at the concept
of Bayesian probability applied to transposition problems and
should be of interest.
