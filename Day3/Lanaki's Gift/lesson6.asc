                            Part II


SUMMARY

In Lecture 6, we continue our review of materials related to
ciphers created in languages other than English.  In order to
augment PHOENIX's soon to be published ACA Xenocrypt Handbook,
we will focus on six diverse systems: Arabic, Russian, Chinese,
Latin, Norwegian, and Hungarian.  Each offers a unique
perspective in deciphering communications and supports the
cultural universal concept presented in Lecture 5.

Lecture 7 will give practical language data for Xenocrypts
commonly published in the Cryptogram - French, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese.  [I will not cover either Esperanto
or Interlinguia.  I consider both as useful as advanced Hittite
in modern communications.]

ARABIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO CRYPTOLOGY

A colleague of mine in Sweden sent me an interesting reminder
of the historical foundations of cryptology.  He suggested that
I include in one of my lectures a discussion of Dr.  Ibrahim A.
Al-Kadi's outstanding 1990 paper to the Swedish Royal Institute
of Technology in Stockholm regarding the Arabic contributions
to cryptology.

Dr. Al-Kadi reported on the Arabic scientist by the name of Abu
Yusuf Yaqub ibn Is-haq ibn as Sabbah ibn 'omran ibn Ismail Al-
Kindi, who authored a book on cryptology the "Risalah fi
Istikhraj al-Mu'amma"  (Manuscript for the Deciphering
Cryptographic Messages) circa 750 AD.  Al-Kindi introduced
cryptanalysis techniques, classification of ciphers, Arabic
Phonetics and Syntax and most importantly described the use of
several statistical techniques for cryptanalysis. [This book
apparently antedates other cryptology references by 300 years.]
[It also predates writings on probability and statistics by
Pascal and Fermat by nearly 800 years.]

Dr. Al-Kadi also reported on the mathematical writings of Al-
Khwarizmi (780-847) who introduced common technical terms such
as 'zero', 'cipher', 'algorithm', 'algebra' and 'Arabic
numerals.' The decimal number system and the concept of zero
were originally developed in India.

The Arabs translated in the early ninth century, Brahmagupta's
"Siddharta" from Sanscrit into Arabic.  The new numerals were
quickly adopted through-out the Islamic empire from China to
Spain.  Translations of Al-Khwarizmi's book on arithmetic by
Robert of Chester, John of Halifax and the Italian Leonardo of
Pisa, aka Fibonacci strongly advocated the use of Arabic
numerals over the previous Roman Standard Numerals
(I,V,X,C,D,M).

The Roman system was very cumbersome because there was no
concept of zero or (empty space).  The concept of zero which we
all think of as natural was just the opposite in medieval
Europe.  In Sanscrit, the zero was called "sunya" or "empty".
The Arabs translated the Indian into the Arabic equivalent
"sifr".  Europeans adopted the concept and symbol but not name,
but transformed it into Latin equivalent "cifra" and
"cephirium" {Fibonnaci did this}.  The Italian equivalent of
these words "zefiro", "zefro" and "zevero". The latter was
shortened to "Zero".

The French formed the word "chiffre" and conceded the Italian
word "zero".  The English used "zero" and "Cipher" from the
word ciphering as a means of computing.  The Germans used the
words "ziffer" and "chiffer".

The concept of zero or sifr or cipher was so confusing and
ambiguous to common Europeans that in arguments people would
say "talk clearly and not so far fetched as a cipher". Cipher
came to mean concealment of clear messages or simply
encryption.  Dr. Al-Kadi concluded that the Arabic word sifr,
for the digit zero, developed into the European technical term
for encryption.  [KADI], [ALKA], [MRAY], [YOUS], [BADE] ,

NOTES ON RUSSIAN LANGUAGE


Reference [DAVI] gives one of the better breakdowns of the
modern Russian Alphabet (Soviet, post 1918) for solving Russian
Cryptograms in "The Cryptogram".

Friedman presents detailed Russian cryptographic data in
Volume 2 of his Military Cryptanalytics series.  [FR2]

A prime difficulty for English speaking students of Russian is
the scarcity of linguistic cognates in the two languages.
Russian is more complex than other romantic languages which
have many common word derivatives.  The highly inflected
Russian grammar aids rather than hinders the cryptographer by
supplying him with valuable tools for decrypting.

My keyboard and supporting software does not permit a
comfortable translation of the Cyrillic, so I refer you  to the
September-October 1976 Cryptogram for a survey of Russian
and several Xenocrypt examples.


RUSSIAN KRIPTOGRAMMA COLLECTION

ELINT

Radio communications can be heard which vary in frequency from
below the broadcast band, to almost the upper edge of the radio
spectrum (Ku-band satellite communications.)

Common bands are:

VLF (Very Low Frequency): 3 to 30 kHz
LF (Low Frequency): 30 to 300 kHz
MF (Medium Frequency): 300 kHz to 3 MHz
HF (High Frequency): 3 to 30 MHz
VHF (Very High Frequency): 30 to 300 MHz
UHF (Ultra High Frequency): 300 to 3000 MHz

Whereas, VHF and UHF frequency ranges are occupied by cellular
phones, police, fire and government communications, the bulk of
HF region is devoted to COMINT signals.  You should be able to
hear traffic from all over the globe, rather than the 50-75
mile limit on the VHF and UHF bands.  Three types of HF radio
communications may be heard/intercepted: continuous wave
(CW/Morse Code), single side band (SSB), and radio teletype
(RTTY).  The Cubans seem to favor the latter form of
communication, especially from their revitalized center at
Lourdes.

Tom Roach [ROAC] has been monitoring Russian messages for some
time.  He uses a Watkins-Johnson HF-1000 receiver, a Rhombic
antenna, a Singer MT-5 Spectrum Analyzer, a Universal M-7000
decoder ( allows viewing the Russian in its native Cyrillic
alphabet) a Sony TCD-07 recorder, and Hitachi V-302F
Oscilloscope with X/Y tuning capability for RTTY
communications.

[ROAC] suggests that the best hunting grounds for Russian RTTY
traffic are:

     4205.5 to 4207.0 kHz
     6300.5 to 6311.5 kHz
     8396.5 to 8414.5 kHz
     12560.0 to 12576.5 kHz
     16785.0 to 16804.5 kHz
     18893.0 to 18898.0 kHz
     22352.0 to 22374.0 khz
     25193.0 to 25208.0 khz

and
     6385 kHz (Morse) at around 1400 UTC


[ROAC] provides the reader with common abbreviations used
in Russian RTTY and Morse traffic.  His book describes the
delicate art (and guess work required) in traffic analysis of
Russian Kriptogramma messages between ship to shore.


Roach has identified several types of Russian messages:

SESS KRIPTOGRAMMA - originated by Soviet Space Event Support
Ships (SESS).

KRIPTOGRAMMA NA PERFOLENTE - refers to a key additive
(originally a paper tape Vernam type series.)

KRIPTOGRAMMA KODA - code book transmissions.

KRIPTOGRAMMA ADMIN - Super enciphered communications.

Other types of messages [ROAC] identified DISP/1 to report
disposition of ships, PAGODA messages for weather reports,
MORE messages to report administrative and sea conditions,
Personal Itinerary, Fuel related, 10 slash, PARTI messages to
discuss status of ship's holds and bunkers.


RUSSKAYA KRIPTOLOGIA HISTORICA

Russian achievements in the art of cryptography rank first rate
to say the least.  Three of my favorite cipher Russian systems
are: 1) Nihilist, 2) VIC - Disruption (aka straddling bipartite
monoalphabetic substitution super-enciphered by modified double
transposition) and 3) the One-Time Pad.  Each of these systems
introduced tactical advantages for adverse communication and
had limited disadvantages for their service.


NIHILIST SUBSTITUTION

For some reason, Russian prisoners were not allowed computers
in their cells.  Inmates were forbidden to talk, and to outwit
their jailers they invented a "knock" system to indicate the
rows and columns of a simple checkerboard (Polybius square at
5x5 for English or 6x6 for 35 Russian letters).  For ex:

                      1  2  3  4  5

                   1  U  N  Ij T  E
                   2  D  S  A  O  F      KW=United States Of
                   3  M  R  C  B  G          America
                   4  H  K  L  P  Q      i/j = same cell
                   5  V  W  X  Y  Z      repeats omitted

CT: 35 24 14 23 33   13 35 23 32 15    14 14 15



Prisoners memorized the proper numbers and "talked"  at about
10-15 words per minute.   One of the advantages was that it
afforded communication by a great variety of media - anything
that could be dotted, knotted, pierced, flashed or indicate
numerals in any way could be used.   The innocuous letter was
always suspicious.  [KAH1]

Cipher text letters were indicated by the number of letters
written together; breaks in count by spaces in handwriting;
upstrokes, downstrokes, thumbnail prints, all subtly used to
bootleg secrets in and out of prisons.  The system was
universal in penal institutions.  American POW's used it in
Vietnam.    [LEWY], [SOLZ]


Transposition of the KW provided a further mixed alphabet:

                     B L A C K S M I T H
                     D E F G N O P Q R U
                     V W X Y Z




 taken off by columns:

 B D V L E W A F X C G Y K N Z S O M P I Q T R H U


 the Polybius square would be:


                      1  2  3  4  5

                   1  B  D  V  L  E
                   2  W  A  F  X  C
                   3  G  Y  K  N  Z
                   4  S  O  M  P  I
                   5  Q  T  R  H  U


The Nihilists, so named for their opposition to the czarist
regime, added a repeating numerical KW .  Making the cipher a
periodic similar to the Vigenere but with additional
weaknesses.

            nulls=774




NIHILIST TRANSPOSITION

A simpler form of the Nihilist was in double transposition.
The plain-text was written in by rows (or diagonals); a keyword
switched the rows; a same or different keyword switched the
columns, and the resulting cipher text was removed by columns
or by one of forty (40) or more routes out of the square.

ex:    KW = SCOTIA   or  524631

Y U T O M   S E U H T    L.

(message length and 5th group are entries to solution)

Clues to cryptanalysis of the Nihilist systems were
reconstructing the routes, evenness of distribution of vowels,
period determination and digram/trigram frequency in cipher
text.  The USA Army for many years used a similar system.
Reference [COUR] discusses the U.S. Army Double Transposition
Cipher in detail.




VIC-DISRUPTION CIPHER

The Vic-Disruption Cipher brought the old Nihilist Substitution
to a peak of perfection.  It merged the straddling checkerboard
with the one-time key.  It increased the efficiency of the
checkerboard by specifically giving the high frequency letters
(O,S,N,E,A; P,G ) the single digits (along with two low
frequency letters).  The seven letters: 'snegopa' comprise
about 40% of normal Russian text.  Let me focus on interesting
elements.


STRADDLING BIPARTITE MONOALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION SUPER-
ENCIPHERED BY MODIFIED DOUBLE TRANSPOSITION or simply, VIC -
DISRUPTION or just "VIC."

The VIC algorithm is described as follows:

The plain text is encoded by a Substitution Table (ST).  The
intermediate cipher text [ICT]  is then passed through two (2)
transposition tables (TT1 and TT2), each performing a different
transposition on the ICT.

TT1 performs a simple columnar transposition: the ICT is placed
in TT1 by rows and removed by columns in the order of TT1's
columnar key and transcribed into TT2.

TT2 is vertically partitioned into Disruption , or D areas.
These partitions are formed by diagonals extending down the
table to the right boundary in columnar key order.  The first D
area begins under column keynumber 1 and extends down to the
right border of TT2.  A row is skipped. The second D area
starts under keynumber 2.  The process continues for the entire
key.  The number of rows in TT2 .ne. TT1 and is calculated by
dividing the number of cipher text input digits by the width of
the table.

The ICT from TT1 is inscribed into TT2 horizontally from left
to right skipping the D areas.   When all the non D area is
filled , then the D areas are filled in the same way.  The
cipher text is removed by column per key order without regard
to the D areas.

KEYS

The VIC system used four memorized keys.  Key 1 - the date of
WWII victory over Japan - 3/9/1945; Key 2 - the sequence of 5
numbers like pi - 3.1415; Key 3 - the first 20 letters of the
"Lone Accordion", or famous Russian song/poem, and Key 4 - the
agent number, say 7.   Key 1 was changed regularly.  Key 4 was
changed irregularly.


DISRUPTION ALGORITHM

The keys were used to generate the keys for transposition and
the coordinates for a checkerboard for substitution through a
complex LRE (Left to right enumeration) logic.  The process
injected an arbitrary 5 number group into the cipher text which
strongly influenced the end result.  This group changed from
message to message, so the enciphering keys (and cipher text)
would bear no exploitable relationship to each other.  Not only
did TT1 and TT2 keys differ but also the widths of the blocks
did as well.

The coordinates kept changing.  The D areas prevented the
analyst from back derivation of the first TT1.  The D areas
increased the difficulty of finding the pattern and the
straddling effect on the checkerboard increased the difficulty
of frequency counts.  Although not impossible to break, in
practice  a tough monkey indeed.  The FBI failed for four years
to solve it.


KEY GENERATION

All arithmetic was done modulo 10, without carrying or
borrowing.

An English ST table might look like this:



               4  9  1  6  0  8  5  2  3  7

               R  E  A  S  O  N  b

            2  B  C  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  M

            3  P  Q  I  U  V  W  X  T  Z  1

            7  3  5  7  9  .  ,  b  $  %  -


b = space character

top line are among most frequent English letters similar to
'SNEGOPAD'  in Russian.

Ambiguity in decipherment is reduced because the last three
slots in the first row are empty and the first coordinate of
the two coordinate characters is unique.

[VOGE] gives a detailed look at the key generation recursion
mathematics for this cipher.  It describes the LRE
(left to right enumeration)  process in nauseating detail.

The TT1 and TT2 are built up on the recursion sequence
X(i+5) = X(i) + X(i+1) for i = 1,5 using mod 10 math.  Key 1
was used to insert at end of message (5th unit in this
example). Key 1 was also the initial point for a series of
manipulations with Key 2,3,and 4.




RUSSIAN IMPROVEMENTS

Hayhanen incorporated some nasty refinements.  Before
encipherment, the plain text was bifurcated and the two halves
switched so that the standard beginnings and endings could not
be identified.  The ST contained a 'message starts' character.
The ST was extended to ASCII characters.   The VIC encipherment
consisted of one round.   After 1970, with the advent of
programmable hand calculators, a multiple round version was
produced.



MERITS

Consisting of simple enough elements, this cipher is one tough
monkey.

The complication in substitution was the straddling device on
the checkerboard.  The irregular alternating of coordinates of
two different lengths makes it harder for cryptanalysis by
dividing the list into proper pairs and singletons.

The complication in the transposition was the Disruption areas.
D areas blocked the reconstruction of the first tableau.  A
correct sorting of the columns is forestalled by the D areas.

The keying method is brutal on the agent in a hurry.  Same with
his analyst counterpart.  Key recovery does not permit direct
anagraming between messages.  The four keys are mnemonics.

The cipher text is only 62% increased over plain text because
of the high frequency letters in the first row of the ST.


ONE-TIME PAD REVISITED

The One-Time Pad was covered in LECTURE 3 and we are reminded
that it is truly an unbreakable cipher system.  There are many
descriptions of this cipher.  Bruce Schneier's  discussions are
quite relevant. [SCHN] , [SCH2]

FRESH KEY DRAWBACK

The One-Time Pad has a drawback - the quantities of fresh key
required.  For military messages in the field (a fluid
situation) a practical limit is reached.  It is impossible to
produce and distribute sufficient fresh key to the units.
During WWII, the US Army's European theater HQs transmitted,
even before the Normandy invasion, 2 million five (5) letter
code groups a day!  It would of therefore consumed 10 million
letters of key every 24 hours - the equivalent of a shelf of 20
average books.  [SCHN]

RANDOMNESS

The real issue for the One-Time Pad, is that the keys must be
truly random.   Attacks against the One-Time Pad must be
against the method used to generate the key itself.  Pseudo-
random number generators don't count; often they have nonrandom
properties.  Reference [SCHN] Chapter 15, discusses in detail
random sequence generators and stream cipher.  [SCHN], [KAHN],
[RHEE]


CHINESE CRYPTOGRAPHY

ENCIPHERING

Dr. August suggests that the Four Corner System and the Chinese
Phonetic Alphabet System lend themselves to manual
cryptographic treatment.   His treatment of these two systems
is easier to understand than some military texts on the
subject. [AUG1]

Let a message in Chinese be X1, X2, X3.. Xn,  where Xi
represents a character.  The code for Xi is vector union of
three sets, v1, v2, and v3.  v1 is a single digit code for tone
v2 is a four or five digit Four Corner representation code,
and v3 is a 6 digit phonetic code representing 3 phonetic
symbols each by two digits.   [AUG2]


                                3
                           Xj = U  v1         eq 1
                               1-3

This union is called an asymmetric code.

The Four Corner System encodes characters into several generic
shapes.  Each character is broken into four (4) quadrants, and
assigned a digit to the generic shape that best corresponds to
the actual shape.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet is Pinyin with symbols instead of
English letters.  Each symbol corresponds to one of 37 ordered
phonetic sounds.  The 21 initial, 3 medial and 13 finals are a
unique ordered set - a true alphabet.

The strength of encryption of Chinese is dependent on the
specific Chinese encoding character schemes.  Three cases are:

  1).  Phonetic Alphabet Only:  The cipher must include both  a
       transposition (to hide cohesion and positional
       limitations) and a substitution (to hide the frequency
       patterns.)

  2)   Four Corner System: The cipher can be based on ring
       operations [performed on codewords rather than
       characters, either on an individual basis or over the
       whole message; the name comes from the algebraic
       operations involving integers mod 10 or mod 37] which
       super-encipher the encoded text.

  3)   Combination of Methods 1) and 2): A text encoded by a
       combination of both methods will need a cipher employing
       both transposition and substitution.  The transposition
       needs to mix up the symbols within codewords and the
       message itself.  This prevents a bifurcated analysis.

Dr. August presents a table of digraphs. [AUG2] Combinations
of Xn - Ym  where n= 0-9  and m=0,1,2,3,4,7 showed highest
frequencies of text encoded with 5 digit scheme.


DEPENDENCE

In Chinese there is more dependence between encoding and
enciphering operations than in English.  The choice of the
encoding system influences the type of enciphering operations.
Dr. August provides solved examples of the above systems.
[AUG2]


HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES

China appears to have had a much delayed entry into the cipher
business.  Partially because so many Chinese did not read or
write, and partially because the language was so complex,
Chinese cryptography was limited until the 19 century.  But
there were seeds:

The Chinese strategist Sun Tzu (500 b.c.) recommended a true
but small code, which limited the plaintext to 40 elements
and assigned them to the first 40 characters of a poem, forming
a substitution table.  Richard Deacon describes a method of
code encryption which the secret society Triads used in the
early  1800's. [DEAC]  The Tong's in San Francisco used the
same system. This method limited the plaintext space and based
codewords on multiples of three.

The "Inner Ring" techniques taught to  Sa Bu Nim's (teachers)
by the masters of Korean Tae Kwon Do (which came from the
Ancient Tae Kwan and before that Kung Fu) were passed on by
means of codeword transposition ciphers.  [CHOI]  In 1985, Sun
Yat-Sen used codes to transmit information by telegraph.
[TUKK])   During WWII, Herbert Yardley taught Kuomintang
soldiers to cryptanalyze Japanese ciphers.  However, the
Japanese had already outpaced the Chinese in cryptanalytical
abilities.



Japan's Chuo tokujobu (Central Bureau Of Signal Intelligence)
was responsible for crypto-communication and signal
intelligence, including cryptanalysis, translation,
interception, and direction finding against the Soviet Union,
China and Britain.  It began operations in 1921.  [YUKI],[YAR1]

In May 1928, the Angohan (Codes and Ciphers Office) obtained
excellent results in intercepting and decoding Chinese codes
during the Sino-Japanese clash at Tsinan between Chiang
Kaishek's Northern Expeditionary Army and the IJA (Imperial
Japanese Army). [FUMI]

The warlord Chang Tso-lin was murdered in June 1928.  Angohan
succeeded in decoding "Young Marshal" Chang Hsueh-liang's
secret communications and made a substantial contribution to
the understanding of the warlord politics of Manchuria. [SANB]

The Anjohan not only mastered the basics of Chinese codes and
ciphers but also broke the Nanking Government and the Chinese
Legation codes in Tokyo. [YOKO]

The Chinese codes in 1935 were called "Mingma".   They were
basically made up of four digit numbers.  The Chinese did not
encode the name of either the sender or receiver, nor the date
or the time of the message.  The China Garrison Army's
Tokujohan office was able to disclose the composition,
strength, and activities of Chiang Kai-shek's branch armies,
such as those led by Sung Che-yuan and Chang Hseuh-liang.  It
was not able to decode the Chinese Communist or Air Force
messages. [HIDE]

By the time of the 1937 Sino-Japanese War,  Japanese
cryptanalytical experts had been able to greatly expand their
knowledge of the Chinese system of codes and ciphers, as well
as improve their decoding skills.  About 80% of what was
intercepted was decoded.  This included military and diplomatic
codes but not the Communist code messages.  [EIIC]

Chinese Nationalists upgraded their Mingma codes in 1938.  They
adopted a different system, called tokushu daihon (special code
book) in Japanese which complicated by mixing compound words.
By October, 1940, Chiang Kai-shek's main forces were using a
repeating key system.  This stumped the Japanese cryptanalysts
for a short time, then they returned to a 75% decoding level
during the war.  They continued to make great contributions to
major military operations in China.  [HIDE]

The Japanese broke the Kuomintang codes during the Chungyuang
Operation in the Southern Shansi or Chungt'iao Mountain
Campaign.  [CHUN]   In February 1941, significant penetration
of Communist signal traffic was obtained. [YOKO]

The tokujo operations against the North China Area Army and the
Chinese Communist codes was tragic failure. [HISA]   The IJA's
China experts held a highly negative image towards the Chinese.



This may have prejudiced their attitude towards intelligence
estimates of China and the Chinese which in turn adversely
affected their operational (crypto-intelligence) thinking on
China in general.  [THEO]

When the Sian mutiny broke out and Chiang Kai-shek was
kidnapped in December 1936, Major General Isogai (IJA's leading
expert in COMINT for China) toasted (more like roasted) the
demise of Chiang.   Colonel  Kanji Ishiwara (Japan's chief
military strategist) deplored the incident because he felt
China was on the brink of unity because of Chiang Kai-shek's
efforts.  He considered the ability to read Chiang's codes just
a matter of doing the business of war.   [SHIN]


LATIN

BRASSPOUNDER  gives us a good introduction to Latin in
Reference [LATI].   Until modern times Latin was a dominant
language in schools, churches, and state in Western Europe.
Professionals use Latin to confuse the general populace.
Latin is closely related to all of the Romance languages.

The Latin alphabet is the same as the English-language
alphabet, except that it has no equivalents for K, W, J, or U.
These have crept into current usage for their phonetic value.
The J replaced I as in hic jacet instead of the classical hic
iacet. The letter W has no equivalent. The letter U was the
Greek Y, and in classical times was written as a U.  C is now
used to form the hard sound as in CEL instead of KEL.  A double
UU approximated a W.  Latin therefore is a 25 letter alphabet.

NORWEGIAN

Norwegian is a beautiful language which consists of two forms,
Bokmal (Book Language) and Nynorsk.  Book language is the
generally read form.   Norwegian is similar to English with the
addition of three vowels AE, 0, A'.  Foreign consonant letters
are C, Q, W, X and Z.  Based on 5153 letters, a frequency
analysis reduced to 100 letters is:

HUNGARIAN

Hungarian (aka Magyar) is related to Finnish and Estonian.
Hungarian has 38 sounds based on a Latin alphabet.  Reference
[HUNG] shows the full alphabet as a combination of letters.
There is no Q, W, or X in Hungarian.  Only 23 Latin letters are
used.  Reference [HUNG] also gives Xenocrypt examples.

Hungarian has four special characteristics:

1.  It agglutinates - adjectives, possessives are expressed by
    suffixes.

2.  It has vowel harmony -  they fall into high and low vowel
    categories.  High - E, I, OE, UE and Low- A O U.  In a word
    they are all either high or low.


3.  It assimilates consonants - usually the third or fourth
    letter from the end.  Many doubles.

4.  It has no gender differentiation.
