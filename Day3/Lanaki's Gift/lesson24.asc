                     SPECIAL TOPICS



COURSE NOTES

Lecture 24 will be devoted to special topics and will
present additional cryptograms for solution.  I will
update and restructure my Volume II references and
resources file. Lecture 24 will constitute my final
efforts. Updated Volume II references will replace
Lecture 25.

Those students interested in course participation
certificates please advise me by e-mail, so I have an
idea how many to order.

Volume II of our textbook is available through RAGYR and
Aegean Park Press.  You are encouraged to buy a copy.
All of the corrections presented to me by our capable
class are included in the book. Those interested in
signed copies please advise by private E-mail, and I
will maintain a small inventory for that purpose.

SUMMARY

I want to clean up some loose ends in the Transposition
area and then shift to a review of some of the more
popular ciphers presented in Lectures 1-20.  I will
present more problems, not so much for a "final exam" as
for a chance to improve/enjoy  our cryptographic skills.
I also want to present some additional legal information
regarding Defamation on the Net (an expansion on my
Privacy Lecture).


UBCHI

The Ubchi (the U is umlauted) is a double columnar
transposition cipher used by the Germans during WWI. It
was broken by the French thanks to in part to a radio
message sent in unprotected cleartext early in the
conflict.


The Ubchi had a keyphrase that was represented by
numerals according to the position of its letters. Two
identical letters were labeled consecutively if they
appeared in the same keyphrase. For example,


            5 3 7 8 9 2 6 1 4 10
Keyword:    h e r r s c h a f t


For the plaintext: First army X Plan five activated X
Cross Marne at set hour.


Ciphertext key block 1:

             5 3 7 8 9 2 6 1 4 10
             h e r r s c h a f t
             -------------------
             F I R S T A R M Y X
             P L A N F I V E A C
             T I V A T E D X C R
             O S S M A R N E A T
             S E T H O U R

The ciphertext was taken off by columns in numerical
order of the keyword columns:

              1     2     3    4     5     6     7
Ciphertext:  MEXE AIERU ILISE YACA FPTOS RVDNR RAVST

  8     9    10
SNAMH TFTAO XCRT.

(Note the 5 letters groups not observed.)

These groups were then transcribed horizontally into
another block beneath the same number sequence:


             5 3 7 8 9 2 6 1 4 10
             h e r r s c h a f t
             -------------------
             M E X E A I E R U I
             L I S E Y A C A F P
             T O S R V D N R R A
             V S T S N A M H T F
             T A O X C R T(Z)

The next step was to add as many Null letters as there
are words in the Keyphrase or Keyword. One null Z was
added after the last letter in the last row, T.

The German encipherer once more took these letters from
the block by columns in the same numerical sequence and
separated into standard groups of five letters each:




  1     2    3      4     5    6      7    8     9
RARHZ IADAR EIOSA UFRTM LTVTE CNMTX SSTOE ERSXA YVNCI

PAF.

To decipher the message, the recipient first had to
discern the size of the transposition rectangle in order
to learn how long the columns were. This was accomp-
lished by dividing the total number of key numbers into
the total number of letters into the message (48 / 10).
The quotient was the number of complete rows. The
remainder 8 was the number of letters in the incomplete
columns.  The succeeding steps reversed the corre-
sponding steps in the enciphering process.

Note the similarity with the U.S. Army Double Trans-
position Cipher System. Barker gives a detailed
breakdown of this type of cipher in his book. [BARK]
It is not coincidental that the two countries at war
had very similar cipher systems in play.


U. S. ARMY DOUBLE TRANSPOSITION CIPHER

One of the more interesting transposition ciphers is the
double transposition cipher. One of the guru's in this
area is Colonel Wayne Barker. His "Cryptanalysis of the
Double Transposition Cipher" is enjoyable reading. I
thank him for his liberal permission to excerpt from his
reference. [BARK2]

In its most effective form the double transposition
cipher is based upon two incompletely filled rectangles
with two different length keywords.  Nulls must be added
before encipherment, not to the end after encipherment.
In the deciphering process, we must determine the exact
dimensions of the enciphering rectangles R-1 and R-2 by
keywords K-1 and K-2, respectively.

The process of encipherment is relatively straight
forward. The plain text is read into R-1 by rows, taken
out by columns in the order of K-1, transcribed into R-2
in rows and removed from R-2 by columns as dictated by
K-2. The ciphertext is then separated into the standard
groups of 5 letters for transmission.

The difficulty in decipherment occurs when we must
determine the exact dimensions of R-1 and R-2 as well as
the sequence and width of K-1 and K-2.  Recall that we
can use the division of the message length by the key
length to give us the number of long columns and length
of the short columns.  For example, for message length
99  with keylength of 13, we have:




                       7     - length of short column
                     ------
     keylength =13  | 99     - message length
                      91
                      --
                       8     - number of long columns


The length of the long columns is 1 more than short or
8.  The number of short columns is 13 - 8 = 5.

This is Step 1.

To decipher the double transposition cipher, the
ciphertext letters are inscribed within R-2, whose
dimensions have been determined in Step 1, following the
column order of K-2.  Thereafter, the horizontal letters
within R-2 are inscribed within R-1 following the column
order of K-1. The resulting plaintext is read horizont-
ally within R-1. So there we have Steps 2 and 3.

Messages In Depth

Regardless of how complex a transposition system may be,
the resulting ciphertext messages may be put in depth,
superimposed one above the other, the resulting columns
may potentially be matched against one another to
produce plaintext. Messages must be the same length.
This is not a difficult requirement, especially when
nulls are added to get an even number letters in groups
of 5.

In essence we construct a giant single columnar
transposition cipher of message length L.  The problem
is reduced to juxtaposing (matching the columns) so that
the plaintext is readable.

Given the following six messages at L = 115 letters:


                             1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2

We look for letters of low frequency such as Q or QU
combinations. We may assume that the messages end in
X(s) for nulls. We start with this fact.








               17  26  37  57  68
                -   -   -   -   -
                R   Y   X   E   I
                X   X   X   X   X
                X   X   X   S   I
                X   X   X   S   I
                O   P   X   T   A
                H   X   X   T   E


Column 37 is the last, 26 is before it, and 17 with
three X's is the antepenultimate column.

                17  26  37
                 -   -   -
                 R   Y   X
                 X   X   X
                 X   X   X
                 X   X   X
                 O   P   X
                 H   X   X

Putting column 57 in the group gives us (QU)ERY and
(S)TOP.  We might work back from this point with maybe
GENERAL SMITH for the last message. We can hook up the
QU's for breaks in the middle of the messages.


              92 48 57 17  26  37
              -  -  -   -   -   -
              Q  U  E   R   Y   X
              R  Y  X   X   X   X
              O  N  S   X   X   X
              N  T  S   X   X   X
              E  S  T   O   P   X
          (S) M  I  T   H   X   X

Solve the rest.

Key Recovery After Anagramming

The next step in the process is to recover the keys.

Given 4 messages of L = 85 letters, and their anagramed
equivalent:

           7 7 7 2 6 2 6 6 6 5 5 4 5 3 4 4 1 3 1 3

The C -> P sequence is also known as the anagram key.
Given the anagram keys we can recover the keys K-1 and
K-2.

The anagram key of the above ciphertext example is:

79 76 72 25 63 22 60 69 66 51 57 42 54 39 48 45 19 36 10
33 07 16 13 30 04 84 01 81 27 24 62 78 74 75 71 59 56 41
68 53 65 50 38 35 09 47 21 44 18 06 03 83 15 32 12 29 80
77 73 26 64 23 61 70 67 52 58 43 55 40 49 46 20 37 11 34
08 17 14 31 05 85 02 82 28

We can index the anagram key as follows:

01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
79 76 72 25 63 22 60 69 66 51 57 42 54 39 48 45 19 36 10


20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38
33 07 16 13 30 04 84 01 81 27 24 62 78 74 75 71 59 56 41

39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57
68 53 65 50 38 35 09 47 21 44 18 06 03 83 15 32 12 29 80

58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76
77 73 26 64 23 61 70 67 52 58 43 55 40 49 46 20 37 11 34

77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85
08 17 14 31 05 85 02 82 28


The indexed version is known as the P -> C sequence. It
is also called the encipher key.  Inverting the encipher
key index gives us the encipher key derived from the
recovered anagram key:

01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
27 83 51 25 81 50 21 77 45 19 75 55 23 79 53 22 78 49 17

20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38
73 47 06 62 30 04 60 29 85 56 24 80 54 20 76 44 18 74 43

39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57
14 70 38 12 68 48 16 72 46 15 71 42 10 66 40 13 69 37 11

58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76
67 36 07 63 31 05 61 41 09 65 39 08 64 35 03 59 33 34 02

77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85
58 32 01 57 28 84 52 26 82

The anagram key is the order of the ciphertext letters
to produce plaintext, and the encipher key is the order
of the plaintext letters to produce ciphertext.

>From the encipher key we derive the Interval Key. The
interval key provides the intervals both positive and
negative, between successive terms of the encipher key.:

+56 -32 -26 +56 -31 -29 +56 -32 -26 +56 -20 -32 +56 -26
-31 +56 -29 -32 +56 -26 -41 +56 -32 -26 +56 -31 +56 -29
-32 +56 -26 -34 +56 -32 -26 +56 -31 -29 +56 -32 -26 +56
-20 -32 +56 -26 -31 +56 -29 -32 +56 -26 -27 +56 -32 -26
+56 -31 -29 +56 -32 -26 +56 -20 -32 +56 -26 -31 +56 -29
-32 +56 -26 +01 -32 +56 -26 -31 +56 -29 +56 -32 -26 +56

We start at identifying K-1 length.  There are three
lengthy repetitions in the interval key starting with
+56 and ending with -26.  We look at the terms that give
rise to these repetitions.

The common difference is the length of K-1.

Using the derived encipher key, the first column is

27 83 51 25 81 50 21 77 45 19 75

We start by reconstructing R-2. We know that its
horizontal rows come from the vertical columns of R-1
and its vertical columns come from the terms of the
encipher key.

                     50
                     21


Knowing the width of R-2 gives the dimensions of R-2.



             85 = 3 - 10's
                  5 - 11's

The reconstruction of R-2 continues as we discover the
order of columns in R-1 entering R-2. This is done by
knowing the vertical terms in R-2, which are successive
terms of the encipher key.


The reconstruction of R-1 and R-2 with keys identified
are:

Solution where known plaintext occurs at any point
within the message.

Barker describes solution of several special "crib"
situations. He uses stereotyped beginnings, endings and
shows the process of overlaying the crib into R-1 and
converting it into R-2. Of more interest is the solution
when the plaintext crib is anywhere in the message.

Consider the following problem:

Now on to K-1 at length 9, we write in the known
plaintext:

                  -----------------
                  R O A D J U N C T
                  I O N Q U E B E C
                  F O X T R O T T W
                  O F I V E E I G H
                  T Z E R O


Focus on column 4 with the infrequent letters of Q and
V.  We can establish this as a row in R-2.  We locate
two columns that fit the pattern.





                       P   P
                       O   N
                       D   O

                       C   X

                       I   W
                       T   O
                       A   D
                       M   P


The column added to R-2 come directly from the
ciphertext. Lets analyze the positional information to
reconstruct R-2.

Q and V occur in positions 46 and 60. We can expect the
length of of K-2 will be a multiple of 14 because the
difference is 14. Letters occurring in the same column
of R-1 which occupy the same row of R-2 will be
separated in the ciphertext by a multiple of R-2 column
lengths. This is a multiple of the key. We might expect
that R-2 is 14 for a column length. Two rectangle widths
give rise to a column length of 14 for L = 119.





                  K-2 = 8
    1]      119 = 7 - 15's
                  1 - 14


                  K-2 = 9
    2]      119 = 2 - 14's
                  7 - 13's


Look at letters H and W:

H= 03

W = 47 50 77  --> distances of 44 47 74 which is
consistent with column length of 15 and 14 for K-2 =8.

So the width of R-2 is 8.  We construct a analytical
matrix of width 8:


                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                   T O S Q A T
                 D R T V A S D O
                 T R O W P W A R

                 S N O E N O O N
                 T O S Q A T O E


Using the DQTVR as the starting column, we locate
columns 5 and 4 of R-1:


                 8 3 6 1 5 7 4 2
                 O T A D Q T V R
                 R O S T A D W T

                 E O C S I L W N
                 O A C E T G O M

                 N O M S E U E O
                 E S O T N O Q



We mark off the known plaintext and work up and down
from the starting row to get the solution with K-1 =9:


                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Wayne's Contribution To Cryptography - Solution that
Requires No Known Plaintext Crib.


Colonel Barker found that any double transposition
cipher can be expressed as an equivalent single

Consider the following double transposition

Note that where the plaintext is a straight numerical
sequence, the resulting ciphertext is the encipher key.
Exactly the same ciphertext or encipher key will result
from the following single columnar transposition cipher:

            matrix = 4 X 20

            63 =  3 long @ 4
                  17 short @ 3


Very simply, the results of using the two double
transposition keys 3-2-1- 5-4  and 3-2-4-1 to encipher
message L = 63 can be duplicated by using the single
transposition key: 18-7-11-5-4-3-17-6-15-14-13-2-16-10-
9-8-12-1-20-19.  This result does not surprise the pure
mathematicians in the group.  The equivalent key, Keqv,
reflects K-1, K-2 and the message length.

K-1 (length) X K-2 (length) = Keqv (length of single
transposition key)

To successfully attack the Keqv problem, the length of
the message, L must be longer than the key.

Two points: 1) Given two double transposition keys,
there are multiplicity of single columnar transposition
keys, each depending upon the length of the plaintext
being enciphered, and 2) Given a particular single
transposition key, there are only two specific double
transposition  keys which will give rise to the single
transposition key; and both keys K-1 and K-2 may be
recovered regardless of the message length L. Keqv can
be considered a rotating matrix.




                  18 03 13 08     3

                  3   2  4  1
                     K-2

The rotating matrix will be in the form of a complete
rectangle and the correct rectangle can be recognized by
each of its rows containing a single, different term of
K-1. There are several symmetrical relations with
respect to this rotating matrix:

1.  The row terms of the matrix are equal to each other
    when considered (MOD n),  where n = length K-1.


    Modulus five for the above rotating matrix is:


                            (mod 5)

       18 03 13 08           3 3 3 3
       07 17 02 12           2 2 2 2
       11 06 16 01           1 1 1 1
       05 15 10 20           5 5 5 5
       04 14 09 19           4 4 4 4


2. There is a difference relationship between row terms.

       18 -  03  =  +15
       03 -  13  =  -10
       13 -  08  =  +05
       08 -  18  =  -10

     for the entire matrix, we have:

                  +15 -10 +05 -10
                  -10 +15 -10 +05
                  +05 -10 +15 -10
                  -10 +05 -10 +15
                  -10 +05 -10 +15


The differences are the same, only rotated. If we
renumber the values in each row as 'indicators' we have
the following row identifications:

                    4 1 3 2
                    2 4 1 3
                    3 2 4 1
                    1 3 2 4
                    1 3 2 4

The row of the matrix containing 1 will not rotate. It
will always reflect the value of K-2. The remaining rows
will rotate with the rotation depending on the length of
the message L. Each row in effect identifies one term of
the key K-1.  If 2 occurs in a particular row, we know
that the position of that row will indicate the position
of 2 in K-1. If we can identify a particular letter of
the ciphertext as part of a column, we can identify one
of the terms in the rotating matrix. The value of that
term (mod n), will provide one of the terms of K-1. It
is related to all the terms in its row mod n.

The solution of ciphertext problems follows the same
lines as discussed previously on a single transposition
rectangle. Barker gives three interesting examples.
[BARK2]  GUNG HO has also addressed the solution of
double transposition ciphers. [GUNG]


THE AUGUSTUS CIPHER

The Augustus Cipher is closely related to the Viggy, and
is attributed (possibly erroneously) to Emperor
Augustus.  The rumor is that he used a passage from
Homer as the key to encrypt his messages.  The key is
equal to the length of the plaintext. He used as much
keytext as required to meet the message size.

To encrypt the Mth letter of the plaintext, select the
Mth letter of the keytext; the position of this letter
in the alphabet determines the shift for the plaintext
letter.  If the Mth plaintext letter  is O and the Mth
key text letter is C, the shift is three, because C is
the 3rd letter in the alphabet, and thus O is replaced
by the R, which is 3 places further along in the
alphabet.  The process is Mod 26. So, the plaintext
letter W encrypted by the key letter F (shift = 6) would
result in the ciphertext letter C.

Example:

Plain: London calling Moscow with urgent message.
Key Phrase: To be or not to be that is the question
whether

Plain:     L  O  N  D  O  N  C  A  L  L  I  N  G  M
Key Text:  T  O  B  E  O  R  N  O  T  T  O  B  E  T
Shift:    20 15  2  5 15 18 14 15 20 20 15  2  5 20
Cipher:    F  D  P  I  D  F  Q  P  F  F  X  P  L  G


Plain:     O  S  C  O  W  W  I  T  H  U  R  G  E  N  T
Key Text:  H  A  T  I  S  T  H  E  Q  U  E  S  T  I  O
Shift:     8  1 20  9 19 20  8  5 17 21  5 19 20  9 15
Cipher:    W  T  W  X  P  Q  Q  Y  Y  P  W  Z  Y  W  I


Plain:     M  E  S  S  A  G  E
Key Text:  N  W  H  E  T  H  E
Shift:    14 23  8  5 20  8  5
Cipher:    A  B  A  X  U  O  J


The Vigenere Tableau can be used to assign letters
similar to the standard Viggy. The main difference is
the Key text can be long and no repeating. The Augustus
cipher can be attacked by dictionary type attacks or
by high frequency letters is groups to identify small
parts of the text.

KEY PHRASE

I don't recall discussing the Key Phrase cipher in much
detail.  It is a regular cryptogram with a few new
twists: 1) a letter may represent itself; 2) a cipher
letter may represent more than one plaintext letter;
3) The key word is a 26 letter key phrase rather than a
disarranged alphabet.

Edgar Allen Poe like this particular cipher. Example:


Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   FORTITERINRESUAVITERINMODO

The Latin Key phrase fortiter in re, suaviter in modo -
"strongly in deed, gently in manner."

In Poe's example, the word GAMES would be enciphered
EFSIE.

Note that letters may be missing from the cipher key. To
solve a key phrase we start with a crib, and work back
and forward between the key sentence and the the
cryptogram.  Remember that one cipher letter may stand
for several plaintext, but each plaintext letter has but
one substitute.

Try these two Key Phrase ciphers and recover their
phrases:


1. Evelyn Wood for drivers?

   VET  EETTA  SERSEVSRT  SA  DOTTE  ATSETER  TD  VESV

ADFGX CIPHERS

The ADFGX cipher was invented by a skilled German
cryptographer during World War I. In the original ADFGX
cipher, there were three stages of encipherment, which
added to the difficulty. The alphabet square permitted
the enciphering alphabet to be inscribed in various
ways: vertically, horizontally, circular, etc. Anyway
that a Tramp could be defined, the cipher alphabet could
be used.  A crib was usually necessary to expedite the
solution.

Here are three forms of the same cipher:




                                          E B O N Y
      a d f g x         S P A C E         B R O W N

DEFAMATION ON THE NET

Law on the net is way behind the technology.  There is a
particular danger and risk in the area of Defamation and
Privacy.  Assume that every thing you write on the net
can be read and disseminated to millions of readers,
without delay. This is particularly true if the
material is "juicy."  This week the Supreme Court must
take up the questions of indecency and pornography on
the net. Do they hold that their jurisdiction is world
wide?  Do they permit anyone to say anything - no matter
how bad - no matter how true - in favor of the First
Amendment Freedom of Speech provisions?

The cards are stacked the wrong way. A person defames
another when he or she makes a false statement about
that person that injures his or her reputation. This
includes both libel and slander.

It is possible for a person to go to a national
provider, like AOL, Free, upload 1,000,000 bytes of pure
trash about you or your family, their medical, sexual,
financial behavior - all being fiction! - to a common
bulletin board, and then drop the service, leaving
behind material that is perused by 1000's of people
a day using "search engines".  In the real world,
reputation can be injured in public discussion, loss of
job opportunity, or professional contact. This is
especially true if one's circle of business and friends
is well connected to the cyber world.  Defamation suits
involve big money - about $100,000 up front and
$150/hour against time spent.

Why?  A statement only defames if it is untrue. If a
reasonable jury would say "so what if he called you..
how were you hurt?," then your case is not strong.
Even when your case is strong, system operators have
strong protection from liability. A major defense is the
public figure exception. Online services qualify for
this exception as both publishers and distributors of
information. The private figure is given more
protection. For practical purposes, a plaintiff can look
forward to many depositions to harass before he will get
his case before the jury. Amicus curiae briefs from all
sorts of groups will surface to stop any restriction on
the ability to defame your neighbor.

Even accusations detailing instances of dishonesty,
disloyalty, distasteful sexual practices, and other
reputation - staining events that never happened give
rise to defamation claims. Even if an online service
prints a retraction, how do you know that EVERY person
who saw the lies will get the retraction? in Europe? In
Africa? etc.   The real problem created by defamations
is the set of unpleasant associations created by the
false accusations. Even when retracted, the negative
image is carried in the mind for years. "Mere opinion"
is protected speech as well as satirical and political
commentary. Look at the attacks on the President.

A violation of Privacy may arise from publishing
messages on an online service about a person's private
affairs that a "reasonable person" would find highly
offensive, and that are not part of the publics
legitimate concern.  As a practical matter the
disclosure must be major and cause great pain and
embarrassment to lead to legal justification for
substantial money damages.

Privacy claims don't apply to events that occur in
public, are a matter of public record, or can be claimed
as newsworthy.

There is a variation on the standard right of privacy
called "false light" privacy. A false light claim arises
when someone reports something about someone else in a
misleading context that injures that person. The false
light claim needs to be offensive to the average reader
or viewer.

Another privacy-related right is that of publicity. It
prevents people from exploiting your name or image for
profit without consent through licensing arrangements
with the owner of the right.

The Daniel v Dow Jones, (520NYS2d 334) case relieved the
online provider from giving out erroneous information
that may injure another.  The court stated, " The First
Amendment precludes the imposition of liability for
nondefamatory, negligently untruthful news." The only
exception to this is when a "special relationship"
existed with the systems operator.

Lance Rose has written an authoritative book on your
online rights called: "Netlaw," The Guidebook to the
Changing Legal Frontier, Osborne Mcgraw-Hill, NY, 1995.
[ROSL]

I feel that cryptography is our way of limiting the
damage -  At least our E-mail can be safe from prying
eyes. We may not be able to stop the loose cannons, but
most of us have integrity and can protect our privacy
with the appropriate use of cryptographic tools.

ON A PERSONAL NOTE


Our course is complete.  Together, we have made a
special contribution to the science of cryptography. We
have brought a new group of interested souls to the ACA.
We have revitalized the very outlook of the ACA. As we
move into the Millennium, we have accomplished our
professional goals and improved our skills.

It has meant a lot to me to be your class facilitator.
Please remember me when you write my VALE.  Explain to
Y-ME that the two years that we have been in cipher-
space together was worth her patience.

Lastly, Classical Cryptography Course Volumes I and II
represent our best efforts to leave a lasting reference
in the study of the science of cryptography.  Please
buy them, put them in your cryptographic library and
help us preserve a great legacy. Send me your comments,
solutions and questions, as you complete the various
lectures.  So that I can order the correct amount, I
need to know how many of you want me to send you a class
participation certificate.  It is not necessary to have
completed all the problems to be eligible. If you
enjoyed the effort and learned something along the way,
then I am happy to include your NOM.

If you have enjoyed my course in classical cryptography,
then Tell the EB, or write MICROPOD, FIZZY, QUIPOGAM,
SCRYER or PHOENIX. They will appreciate your comments. I
also would like to have your comments and evaluations so
that I can improve the material should I attempt a rerun
of this course at a later date.

My best to you and your families. Again, I am deeply
honored to have been your teacher / facilitator for this
course.
