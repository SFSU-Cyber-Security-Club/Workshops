The specifics of setting up this Docker manually
is essentially the same for Day2 but with another library
added to the /usr/lib directory of the image, which is basically
only done because patchelf corrupts the file if trying to make
it use the local shared library

Theres also setup involved for created a jail so theres just a 
minor tweak with permissions for the individual files, but the 
gist of everything is essentially the same
