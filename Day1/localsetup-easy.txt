To setup a local session, simply compile
the source code with the following flags (disables mitigations)

gcc asm-template -o shellcodeme -fno-stack-protector -L./container/lib -lseccomp
    -----------     -------                 |       |                      |includes this shared library
       source       execs name              |     specifies where to look for shared libraries 
                                        disables buffer overflow protector lol

you should be able to start right away by executing
./shellcodeme
